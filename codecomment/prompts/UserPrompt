For each function you should give the function name followed by a colon and then the docstring.

For example, given the following input method:

    reverse_str1 = ''
    i = len(str1)
    while i > 0:
        reverse_str1 += str1[i - 1]
        i = i- 1
    return reverse_str1

You should output:

Returns:
    reverse(str1):The string which gets reversed.
