  Subject: Homework Questions for EECS 221 - Program Analysis

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 221 - Program Analysis course. I have a few questions regarding the homework assignments in the syllabus.

Firstly, I am curious about the format of the homework assignments. Will they be in the form of programming assignments or written assignments? Additionally, will the assignments involve analyzing and visualizing code, or will they focus on other aspects of program analysis?

Secondly, I was wondering if there are any specific tools or resources that we will be expected to use for the homework assignments? Are there any particular programming languages or frameworks that we should be familiar with?

Finally, I would like to know if there are any specific guidelines for submitting homework assignments. Are there any particular file formats or submission deadlines that we should be aware of?

Thank you for your time and assistance, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
