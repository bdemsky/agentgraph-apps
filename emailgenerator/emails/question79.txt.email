  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring. I am writing to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know the following:

1. Will the assignments involve coding in a specific programming language, or can we use any language we prefer?
2. Are there any specific tools or software required for the assignments?
3. Are there any particular topics or areas of focus that you would like us to cover in our assignments?
4. Are there any guidelines or rubrics for completing the assignments, or can you provide some examples of what you are looking for?

I am excited to dive into the course material and complete the assignments to the best of my abilities. Your guidance on these matters would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
John Smith
