  Subject: Question about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency course. I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about the homework assignments in the course syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know if there are any specific topics or areas of focus that you would like us to concentrate on when completing the homework assignments.

As you mentioned in the syllabus, the course will explore formalisms for reasoning about concurrent data structures and the development of concurrent data structures including lock-free and wait-free data structures. I am excited to delve into these topics and understand how to design and implement scalable data structures. However, I would like to make sure that I am focusing my homework assignments on the most relevant and important areas of the course.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to approach the homework assignments and what you would like us to prioritize? I am committed to doing my best in the course and want to make sure that I am meeting your expectations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
