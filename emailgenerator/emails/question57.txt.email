  Subject: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I have a few questions about the expectations for each assignment and how to properly submit them.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could clarify the format for submitting assignments. Should they be committed as a single commit in the repository, or can they be submitted in smaller commits throughout the development process?

Secondly, are there any specific tools or software that we are expected to use for the assignments, such as compilers or IDEs? And are there any specific programming languages or paradigms that we should focus on?

Lastly, I was curious about the grading criteria for each assignment. How will you and the TAs evaluate the quality of the code, and what factors will be taken into account when determining the grade?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
