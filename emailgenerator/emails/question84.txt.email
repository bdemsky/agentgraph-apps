  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring. I've gone through the syllabus, and I have a few questions regarding the assignments that will be due throughout the semester.

Firstly, could you please clarify the format for the programming assignments? Are they to be submitted in a specific programming language, such as Java or Python? And are there any specific requirements or guidelines for the code organization and structure?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific topics or areas of focus that you would like us to cover in our written assignments? Are there any particular aspects of program analysis that you would like us to explore in greater depth?

Lastly, I was curious about the grading criteria for the final examination. Will it be a take-home exam or a in-class exam? And how long will the exam be?

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
