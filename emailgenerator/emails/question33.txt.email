  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was going through the course syllabus and I have a question regarding the assignments.

In section 4.1 of the syllabus, it is mentioned that assignments must be well documented with useful comments. I was wondering if you could provide some more details on what constitutes "useful comments" in the context of the assignments? How detailed should the comments be, and should they include explanations for the code or just basic documentation?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific formatting or structure requirements for the comments? Should they be in a particular format, such as a comment block or a documentation string?

I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on this matter. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

John Smith
