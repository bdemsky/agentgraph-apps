  Subject: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency class this spring. I have a few questions regarding the assignments in the syllabus.

Firstly, I would like to know if it is okay to discuss the assignments with my classmates? I understand that you encourage us to discuss the class material, but I want to make sure if it's fine to discuss the assignments as well.

Secondly, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the grading criteria for the assignments. I want to make sure I understand what is expected of me when it comes to writing the code and the evaluation process.

Lastly, I noticed that the course slides are available on Google Drive, but I couldn't access them. Could you please provide me with the correct link or let me know if there's anything else I need to do to access them?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
