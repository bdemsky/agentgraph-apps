  Subject: Questions about Concurrent Data Structures in COMPSCI 295

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 class this spring. I am writing to ask for clarification on a few points regarding the course syllabus. I am particularly interested in the topic of concurrent data structures, which is listed as one of the main topics to be covered in the class.

Firstly, I would like to know if you could provide some more information on the different formalisms for reasoning about concurrent data structures that you mentioned in the syllabus. I am familiar with the basics of concurrent programming, but I am not sure which formalisms you will be covering in the course.

Secondly, I am curious about the tools you will be using to explore common hardware and language memory models in the class. I have experience with some model checkers, but I would like to know which specific tools you will be using and why.

Lastly, I was wondering if you could provide any guidance on how to approach the coding projects involving the development of lock-free and wait-free concurrent data structures. I have some experience with concurrent programming, but I am not sure how to design and implement these types of structures in a scalable and correct manner.

Thank you for your time and expertise, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
