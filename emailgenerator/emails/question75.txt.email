  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 221 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question regarding the assignments.

In section 9 of the syllabus, it mentions that each assignment must contain a statement certifying that the work is original and not copied from any other person or source. My question is, will the assignments be automatically checked for plagiarism using an automated tool, or will we be responsible for manually checking our work? Additionally, if we are responsible for checking our own work, are there any specific guidelines or resources provided by the course for doing so?

I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
