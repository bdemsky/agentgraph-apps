  Subject: Request for Clarification on Recording in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the recording section in the syllabus for Computer Science 142A: Compilers and Interpreters. Specifically, I would like to know if the lectures, discussions, and labs will be recorded and posted online, and if so, how we can access them.

As a student, I find it helpful to review the lectures and discussions after class, and having them recorded would allow me to do so more conveniently. Additionally, I believe that recording the lectures and discussions can provide a valuable resource for students who may have missed a class or want to revisit a particular topic.

Could you please let me know if this is something that will be available, and if so, how I can access the recordings? I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
