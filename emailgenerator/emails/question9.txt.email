  Subject: Question about Homework in EECS 114

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was going through the syllabus and I had a question about the homework assignments. Specifically, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the commenting requirements for the programs we submit.

In section 4.1 of the syllabus, it is mentioned that programs must be well documented with useful comments. However, I am not sure what constitutes "useful" comments and how many comments are required for each assignment. Could you please clarify this for me?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific formatting guidelines for the comments that we should follow. For example, should the comments be in a particular format or should they be written in a certain style?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
John Smith
