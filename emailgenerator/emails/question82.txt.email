  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring. I have gone through the syllabus and have a few questions regarding the assignments.

Firstly, could you please provide more details on the programming assignments and written assignments? What kind of topics will we be covering, and how will they be graded? Are there any specific requirements or guidelines for the assignments, such as file formats or submission deadlines?

Secondly, I was wondering if you could clarify the grading policy for the course. What is the breakdown of the 30% final examination, 60% homeworks/projects, and 10% participation? How will the participation grade be calculated, and what are some examples of activities that will contribute to the participation grade?

Lastly, I wanted to inquire about the academic honesty policy. As you mentioned in the syllabus, cheating is a serious academic offense, and I want to ensure that I understand the expectations and consequences. Can you provide more information on what constitutes cheating, and how can I avoid it in my assignments?

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your response. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any further clarification.

Best regards,

John Smith
