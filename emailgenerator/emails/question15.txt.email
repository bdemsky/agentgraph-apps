  Subject: Questions about Lectures in the Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters Course Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I was reviewing the course syllabus and have a few questions about the lectures.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more details about the lectures on "Scanning" and "Parsing part 1" scheduled for April 6th and 13th, respectively. Will these lectures cover the basics of scanning and parsing, or will they delve deeper into more advanced topics?

Additionally, I am curious to know if you will be discussing any specific scanning and parsing algorithms during these lectures, such as context-free grammars, top-down vs. bottom-up parsing, or any other relevant topics.

Lastly, I wanted to clarify the time and location of the lectures. The syllabus states that they will be held in RH104, but I cannot find this room on campus. Could you please provide the correct location or a link to a map of the campus with the room's location?

Thank you for your time and assistance, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
