  Sure, here's an example email that John Smith could send to the professor:

Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course this semester. I was going through the syllabus and have a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1 of the syllabus, it is mentioned that assignments must be turned in on time and late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. I was wondering if you could clarify what constitutes a late assignment? Are we allowed to turn in assignments within a certain timeframe after the due date, or must they be submitted exactly on the due date?

Additionally, I noticed that the syllabus does not provide any details about the format for submitting assignments. Are we supposed to submit them in a specific file format, or is it okay to submit them in any format?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
