  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

Hello, my name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your EECS 40 course this semester. I was going through the syllabus and I have a question regarding the assignments. Specifically, I am curious to know if there are any specific guidelines or requirements for commenting code in the assignments.

As you mentioned in the syllabus, programs must be well documented with useful comments, and excessive, insufficient, or useless comments will result in deducted points. I want to make sure I understand what is expected of me in terms of commenting my code.

 Could you please provide some additional guidance or clarify any specific requirements regarding code commenting in the assignments? I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
