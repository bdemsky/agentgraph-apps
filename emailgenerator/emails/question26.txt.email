  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am one of the students enrolled in your EECS 40 course this semester. I was going through the syllabus and I have a question regarding the assignments.

In section 4.1 of the syllabus, it is mentioned that programs must be well documented with useful comments. However, I am confused about what constitutes "useful comments." Could you please provide some guidance on this? What kind of comments are considered useful and how do I ensure that my code is well documented?

Additionally, I was wondering if you could clarify the format for submitting assignments. The syllabus mentions that assignments should be turned in on time, but it does not provide any details on how to submit them. Should we submit our code to a specific repository or is there a particular format we need to follow?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
