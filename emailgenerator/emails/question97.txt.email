  Subject: Question about Concurrency in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency class this spring. I am writing to inquire about the course material and assignments. Specifically, I am interested in learning more about the topic of concurrency and how it will be covered in the class.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that the class will explore formalisms for reasoning about concurrent data structures and the development of concurrent data structures including lock-free and wait-free data structures. I am curious to know what specific topics will be covered under these categories and how they will be taught in the class.

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide any recommendations for resources outside of the course material that I can use to better understand the concepts of concurrency and how they are applied in practice.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
