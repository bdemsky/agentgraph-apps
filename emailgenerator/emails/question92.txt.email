  Subject: Question about Assignment in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency class. I hope this email finds you well. I have a question regarding one of the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I am curious about the statement you made regarding the use of automated tools to detect copied code.

Could you please provide more information on the types of algorithms these tools use and how they are able to detect copied code even when all methods, fields, classes, and variables have been renamed? I am interested in understanding the technology behind these tools and how they can help us avoid plagiarism in our assignments.

Additionally, I would like to know if there are any specific resources or guidelines that you recommend for students to use when completing their assignments to ensure that they are not copying code from other sources.

Thank you for your time and expertise. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
