  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1, it is mentioned that assignments must be well documented with useful comments. I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on what constitutes "useful comments"? Are we expected to include comments for every line of code, or are there certain areas of the code where comments are particularly important?

Additionally, I noticed that late assignments will receive reduced credit. Are there any exceptions to this policy, or are there any consequences for missing a deadline?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
