  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this semester. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I am curious to know if you could provide more details on what constitutes "excessive, insufficient, or useless comments" in the programs we submit for grading.

As a student, I want to make sure I understand the expectations for this aspect of the course and avoid any potential deductions in points. Could you please clarify this for me?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
John Smith
