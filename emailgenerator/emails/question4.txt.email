  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I am curious about the weightage of assignments in the final grade. The syllabus mentions that assignments are worth 50% of the final grade, but it does not provide a breakdown of how the assignments are divided throughout the course.

Could you please let me know the breakdown of the assignments and their weightage in the final grade? I want to make sure I am allocating my time and effort accordingly.

Additionally, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that late assignments will receive reduced credit. Can you please clarify what constitutes a late assignment and what the penalties are for submitting an assignment late?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
