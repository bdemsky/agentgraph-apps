  Sure, here's an example email that John Smith could send to the professor:

Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to inquire about the assignments in EECS 114, specifically the ones that are due in the upcoming weeks. I was wondering if you could provide some more information on the assignments, such as the due dates, the format, and any specific requirements or guidelines that I should be aware of.

I'm looking forward to hearing back from you and I appreciate your time and assistance.

Best regards,

John Smith
