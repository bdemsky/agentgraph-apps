  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1, it is mentioned that assignments must be well documented with useful comments. I was wondering if you could clarify what constitutes "useful comments"? Are we expected to include comments for every line of code, or just for the major components of the program? Additionally, are there any specific formats or styles that we should follow for our comments?

Also, in section 4.2, it is mentioned that Android is the platform used for this course. I have a MAC and was wondering if it is possible to install Android on it? If so, could you provide any instructions on how to do so?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
