  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1, it is mentioned that assignments must be well documented with useful comments. I was wondering if there are any specific guidelines or requirements for the level of documentation expected? For example, should each function or method have a detailed description, or are shorter comments sufficient?

Additionally, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that late assignments will receive reduced credit. Are there any penalties for submitting an assignment that is significantly late, or is a small delay (e.g. by a few hours) acceptable?

Thank you in advance for your time and help. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
