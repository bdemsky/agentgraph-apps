  Subject: Questions about Programming Assignments in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring. I am writing to inquire about the programming assignments listed in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know the following:

1. Will the programming assignments be provided in the form of a set of problem statements, or will they be given in the form of a coding challenge?
2. Are there any specific programming languages or tools that we are expected to use for the assignments?
3. Are there any specific guidelines or restrictions on the structure or organization of the assignments?
4. Will there be any deadlines or milestones for submitting the assignments, or will they be due at the end of the course?

I am excited to get started on the assignments and would appreciate any guidance you can provide. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

John Smith
