  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course this semester. As I am reviewing the syllabus, I have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I am curious to know if you have any specific guidelines or requirements for the level of documentation required in the programs we submit for the assignments.

As mentioned in section 4.1 of the syllabus, programs must be well documented with useful comments. However, I am not sure what constitutes "useful" comments or how detailed they should be. Could you please provide some more information on this topic?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific file formats or programming languages that we are required to use for the assignments?

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
