  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. As I was going through the course syllabus, I had a few questions regarding the assignments. Specifically, I was wondering if you could clarify the following points:

1. What is the format for submitting assignments? Will they be accepted via a specific platform or can we submit them directly to the course website?
2. Are there any specific guidelines for commenting code? Are comments required to be in a particular format or should they include specific information?
3. Are there any penalties for submitting assignments late? If so, how much of a penalty can we expect and are there any exceptions?

I apologize if these questions are answered in the syllabus, but I couldn't find the information I was looking for. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with clarification on these points.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
