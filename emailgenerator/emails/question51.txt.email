  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. In section 4.2, it is mentioned that assignments must be turned in on time and late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. I was wondering if there are any exceptions to this rule, such as in cases of extreme circumstances or medical emergencies?

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide more details on what constitutes "excessive, insufficient, or useless comments" in the programs? How will these comments be evaluated, and what is the criteria for deducting points?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
John Smith
