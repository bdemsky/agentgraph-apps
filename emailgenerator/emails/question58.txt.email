  Subject: Question about Midterm in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and noticed that there is a midterm exam scheduled for 10% of the final grade. I was wondering if you could provide more details about the midterm, such as the date, duration, and format (e.g., multiple choice, short answer, etc.).

Additionally, I was curious to know if there will be any additional practice quizzes or exams throughout the quarter to help students prepare for the final exam.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
John Smith
