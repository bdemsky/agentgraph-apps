  Subject: Query on Schedule in the Syllabus for Computer Science 142A

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am one of the students enrolled in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I was going through the syllabus, and I noticed that the schedule section is subject to changes as necessary. I was wondering if you could provide some more information on the expected schedule for the course.

 Specifically, I was curious to know the dates for the topics you mentioned in the syllabus, such as "Bottom Up Parsing" and "Intro to Optimizations." Are these topics going to be covered in the order listed in the syllabus, or are there any changes in the schedule?

I understand that changes in the schedule may occur, but I would like to have an idea of the expected dates for these topics so that I can plan my studies accordingly. Your clarification on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

John Smith
