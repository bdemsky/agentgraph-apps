  Sure, here's an email that John Smith could send to the professor:

Subject: Query on Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to inquire about the assignments in the EECS 114 syllabus. I was wondering if you could provide some more details on the assignments, such as the format, file submission requirements, and any specific guidelines or restrictions for the code.

I'm particularly interested in understanding the expectations for the "Well Documented Code" requirement mentioned in section 4.1 of the syllabus. How much flexibility do we have in terms of the style and structure of our comments, and are there any specific templates or guidelines we should follow?

Additionally, I was curious to know if there are any specific topics or concepts that we should focus on in our assignments, or if there are any particular programming languages or tools that we should use.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I'm looking forward to a productive and informative course.

Best regards,

John Smith
