  Subject: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency course this spring. I have a few questions regarding the assignments in the syllabus that I would like to discuss with you.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the format of the assignments. Will they be individual or group assignments? And if they are group assignments, how will we be working together and communicating with each other?

Additionally, I noticed that you mentioned that the assignments will be submitted through a Google Drive folder. Could you please provide more information on how to access this folder and what the submission process will entail?

Lastly, I was curious to know if there will be any sample assignments or practice problems available before the assignments are due. I want to make sure I understand the requirements and expectations for each assignment.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
