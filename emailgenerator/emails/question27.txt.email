  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was going through the course syllabus and have a question regarding the assignments. Specifically, I am curious to know if there are any specific guidelines or requirements for the level of complexity or the amount of code required in each assignment.

I understand that the syllabus mentions that assignments should be turned in on time and that late assignments will receive reduced credit. However, I would like to know if there are any specific benchmarks or targets that I should aim for in terms of the amount of code I write or the complexity of the problems I solve.

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any resources or tools available to help me manage my time and stay organized throughout the course. I want to make sure that I am able to complete all the assignments to the best of my abilities and avoid any issues with plagiarism or academic dishonesty.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
