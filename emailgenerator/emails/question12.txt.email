  Subject: Questions about Lectures in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am writing to inquire about the lectures outlined in the syllabus. I have a few questions regarding the topics and readings assigned for each lecture.

Could you please provide more details about the topics that will be covered during the lectures on "Overview of Compilers" on April 4th and 6th? I want to make sure I am prepared for these lectures and understand the concepts that will be discussed.

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how to approach the reading assignments for the "Scanning" lecture on April 6th and 11th. I want to make sure I am keeping up with the coursework and understanding the material.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
