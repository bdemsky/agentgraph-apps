  Subject: Question about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency class this spring. I am writing to inquire about the assignments in the course syllabus.

Specifically, I am interested in knowing if there are any specific guidelines or requirements for formatting and organizing the assignments. For example, are there any specific file naming conventions or structural requirements for the assignments? Additionally, are there any specific tools or software that you prefer us to use for coding and testing our assignments?

I understand that you mentioned in the syllabus that you will post the course slides in a Google drive folder, but I couldn't find the folder link in the syllabus. Could you please provide the link or update it in the syllabus so that we can access it easily?

Lastly, I would like to clarify the academic honesty policy in the syllabus. As a graduate student, I understand the importance of academic integrity and the consequences of cheating. However, I want to make sure that I understand the policy correctly. Could you please provide more details on what constitutes cheating in the course and the consequences of cheating?

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
