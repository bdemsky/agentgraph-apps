  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was reviewing the syllabus for the course and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I am curious about the format of the assignments and how they will be graded.

Will the assignments be in the form of coding challenges or will they involve writing code to solve specific problems? Also, how will you evaluate the assignments in terms of the 50% weightage you have allocated to them in the grading policy?

I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide on this matter. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

John Smith
