  Sure, here's an example email that John Smith could send to the professor:

Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your EECS 114 course this semester. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1, it is mentioned that programs must be well documented with useful comments. However, I am not sure what constitutes "useful" comments. Could you please provide some guidance on what kind of comments are expected? Are there any specific requirements or guidelines that I should follow?

Additionally, in section 5, it is mentioned that late assignments will not be graded and may not receive credit. I have a conflicting commitment on one of the assignment due dates and was wondering if it would be possible to submit the assignment a day late without penalty?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

John Smith
