  Subject: Question about Homework in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 221 course, Program Analysis. I hope this email finds you well. I have a question regarding the homework assignments in the course syllabus.

I was wondering if you could provide more details on the homework assignments, such as the specific topics we will be covering and the expected complexity of the assignments? I want to make sure I am adequately prepared for the assignments and that I understand the expectations.

Additionally, I was curious if there are any specific tools or resources that we will be using for the homework assignments? I want to make sure I have everything I need to complete the assignments successfully.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
