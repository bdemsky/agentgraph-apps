  Subject: Questions about Software Failures in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 221 course, Program Analysis, this spring. As I read through the syllabus, I came across the section on software failures and was intrigued by the examples you provided. I was wondering if you could provide more information on this topic and its significance in the field of software development.

Could you explain why software failures are a significant problem in today's society and how they can cause such severe consequences? How do you see software analysis and program analysis playing a role in preventing or mitigating these failures?

Additionally, I was curious to know if you have any recommended readings or resources that delve deeper into the topic of software failures and their causes? I am eager to learn more about this topic and how it relates to the course material.

Thank you for your time and expertise, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
