  Subject: Questions about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency course this spring. I have a few questions regarding the homework assignments in the syllabus.

Firstly, I was wondering if there are any specific tools or software required for the homework assignments? Some of the slides in the course syllabus mention the use of model checkers, but I am not sure if these tools are provided or if I need to download them separately.

Secondly, are there any specific guidelines or requirements for formatting and submitting the homework assignments? I want to make sure I follow the correct protocol to avoid any issues during submission.

Lastly, I was curious to know if there are any examples or templates available for the homework assignments? Some guidance on how to structure and organize the code would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
