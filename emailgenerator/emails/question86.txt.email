  Subject: Concurrency in Advanced Concurrency (COMPSCI 295)

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your Advanced Concurrency (COMPSCI 295) course this spring. I am writing to inquire about the topic of concurrency in the course syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know more about the following points:

1. What are the different formalisms for reasoning about concurrent data structures that we will be exploring in the course?
2. Can you elaborate on the design of scalable data structures and how they are implemented using programming languages?
3. Are there any specific tools or model checkers that we will be using to help develop correct concurrent data structures?

I am excited to dive deeper into the topic of concurrency and learn from your expertise in the field. Your experience and insights will be invaluable to me as a student. Please let me know if you have any additional resources or materials that you recommend for further reading on these topics.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
