  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I am curious about the weightage of the assignments in the course grade. According to the syllabus, assignments are worth 50% of the total grade, but it does not specify the exact percentage for each assignment. Could you please provide me with the breakdown of the assignment weightage?

Additionally, I was wondering if it is possible to submit assignments on a non-lab day if I am unable to make it to the designated lab session. I understand that late assignments will receive reduced credit, but I want to ensure that I am not penalized for missing a lab session due to unforeseen circumstances.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
