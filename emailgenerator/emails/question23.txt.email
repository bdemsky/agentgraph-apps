  Subject: Questions on Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency course this spring. I am writing to inquire about the assignments in the course syllabus. Specifically, I have a couple of questions regarding the assignments:

1. Will the assignments be available in the Google Drive folder by the specified deadlines, or will they be available at a later time? I want to make sure I plan my time accordingly.
2. Are there any specific tools or software required for the assignments? I want to ensure that I have everything I need before starting the assignments.
3. Are there any particular programming languages or frameworks that we are expected to use for the assignments? I want to make sure I am familiar with the tools we will be using.

Additionally, I wanted to clarify the academic honesty policy regarding assignments. I understand that cheating is not tolerated, and I want to make sure I am aware of the consequences of any violations. Can you please provide more details on what constitutes cheating and the penalties for such actions?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
