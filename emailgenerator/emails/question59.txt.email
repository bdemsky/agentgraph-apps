  Subject: Questions about Lectures in the Compiler and Interpreters Course Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am enrolled in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the lectures in the course syllabus. Specifically, I have a few questions about the schedule and format of the lectures.

Could you please confirm the exact dates and times of the lectures for the course? According to the syllabus, the lectures are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:00-9:20 am in RH104, but I would like to double-check the schedule to ensure I do not miss any sessions.

Additionally, I was wondering if the lectures will be recorded and made available for students who cannot attend the live sessions? I understand that the syllabus mentions that lectures will be recorded and posted online, but I would like to know if this is a regular practice or if it only applies to certain lectures.

Lastly, are there any specific topics or areas that you will be covering in the lectures that are not listed in the syllabus? I want to make sure I am adequately prepared for the course and understand the material that will be covered.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
