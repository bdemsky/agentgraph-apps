  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I was wondering if you could provide more details on what constitutes "excessive, insufficient, or useless comments" in the programs for the assignments?

As a student, I want to make sure I understand the expectations for the assignments and how to properly document my code. Could you please let me know if there are any specific guidelines or examples that I can refer to?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
