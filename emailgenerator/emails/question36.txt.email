  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was going through the syllabus and have a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1, it is mentioned that programs must be well documented with useful comments. I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on what constitutes "useful comments" and how many comments are expected per program? Additionally, are there any specific requirements for the format or structure of the comments?

Also, in section 4.2, it is mentioned that Android is the platform used for the course. Can you please provide some guidance on how to install Android on a USB stick if I don't own a computer with enough time in the lab sessions? I would appreciate any tips or resources you can share on this.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
