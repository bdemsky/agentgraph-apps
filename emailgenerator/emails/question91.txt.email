  Subject: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the assignments in the course syllabus. Specifically, I have a few questions regarding the lecture slides and the book required for the course.

Could you please provide more details on the format of the lecture slides, such as the topics that will be covered and the level of detail provided? Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific requirements for the book, The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, beyond the required version published in June 2012?

Furthermore, I was curious to know if there are any specific guidelines or tools that we can use to ensure academic honesty in our assignments. As you mentioned in the syllabus, plagiarism is a serious academic offense and I want to make sure I am aware of any resources available to help me avoid it.

Thank you for your time and expertise. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
