  Subject: Question about Lectures in COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency course this spring. I hope this email finds you well. I was going through the syllabus and I have a question regarding the lectures.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that the lectures will be held via Zoom video conferencing at 11am-12:20pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, I couldn't find any information on the course slides or the syllabus regarding the specific dates and topics for the lectures. Could you please provide me with the detailed schedule of lectures, including the dates and topics, so that I can plan my studies accordingly?

Additionally, is there any way to access the course slides or any other resources that you will be using during the lectures? I want to make sure that I am well-prepared for the lectures and can follow along with the material.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
