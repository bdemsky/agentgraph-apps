  Subject: Question about Homework in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring semester. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the homework assignments.

In section 9 of the syllabus, it is mentioned that homework assignments will account for 60% of the final grade. Could you please clarify what types of assignments we can expect and how they will be graded? For example, will they be individual or group assignments, and will they involve coding or more theoretical questions?

Additionally, are there any specific tools or programming languages that we are expected to use for the homework assignments?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
