  Subject: Question about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency course. I hope this email finds you well. I was going through the course syllabus and I have a question regarding the homework assignments.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that the homework assignments will be posted online and will cover various topics related to concurrent data structures and their development. My question is, will the homework assignments be graded based on the correctness of the code submitted or will they also be evaluated based on the performance of the implemented data structures?

Additionally, will there be any additional resources or guidance provided for the homework assignments, such as example implementations or tutorials? I want to make sure I have a good understanding of the concepts and can implement them correctly in my code.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
