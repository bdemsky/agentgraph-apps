  Subject: Questions about Assignments in Computer Science 142A

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I was going through the syllabus and have a few questions regarding the assignments.

Firstly, I was wondering if it is possible to submit assignments as a single commit in the git repository instead of committing separately as I develop the code? I know it is not ideal, but I prefer to work on the assignments in large chunks, and submitting them all at once might be more convenient for me.

Additionally, I was reading through the grading criteria, and I noticed that late penalties are applied for assignments submitted beyond the deadline. Can you please clarify what constitutes a "significant disparity in work between the partners"? Are we expected to contribute equally to each assignment, and if so, how will the grading be affected if one partner contributes more than the other?

Lastly, I was wondering if there are any resources available for students who are struggling with the assignments or need additional clarification on certain concepts? I know the course is challenging, and I would appreciate any additional support.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
