  Subject: Question about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency class. I hope this email finds you well. I have a question regarding the homework assignments in the syllabus.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that each assignment must contain a statement certifying that the files submitted represent the student's own work and that they did not copy any code from other people or sources. My question is, what constitutes "copied code"? Are we allowed to use existing implementations of concurrent data structures as a starting point for our own implementations, or are we expected to come up with everything from scratch?

Additionally, are there any specific tools or resources that we are expected to use for our homework assignments? For example, are we expected to use any specific model checkers or other debugging tools?

Thank you for your time and clarification on these matters. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
