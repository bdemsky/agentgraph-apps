  Subject: Question about Lectures in the Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters course. I hope this email finds you well. I was going through the syllabus and I had a few questions regarding the lectures.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that lectures will be recorded and posted online. Could you please provide more details on how to access these recordings? Will they be available on the course's Yuja page or through any other platform?

Additionally, will there be any live streaming or virtual attendance options for lectures, especially for students who may not be able to attend in person?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
