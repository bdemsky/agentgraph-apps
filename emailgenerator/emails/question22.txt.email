  Subject: Questions about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency class. I am writing to inquire about the homework assignments for the course.

From the syllabus, it appears that there will be weekly homework assignments, with the first one due on Tuesday, March 10th. I was wondering if you could provide some more details about the format of the homework, such as the types of problems we will be solving, the expected time commitment, and any specific tools or resources that we will need to use.

Additionally, I was curious to know if there are any particular topics or concepts that you would like us to focus on in our homework assignments. As a reminder, I am already familiar with computer architecture, operating systems, algorithms, and the use of threads and locks, so I want to make sure I am focusing on the most relevant topics for the class.

Finally, I noticed that you mentioned in the syllabus that you will be using an automated tool to detect copied code in our assignments. Could you please provide more information about this tool, such as its name and how it works? I want to make sure I am aware of any potential issues or challenges that may arise when using it.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
