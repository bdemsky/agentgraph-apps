  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I am curious about the requirements for the comments on the programs.

As stated in section 4.1 of the syllabus, "Programs must be well documented with useful comments. Excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points." I would like to clarify what constitutes "useful comments" and how many comments are expected per program.

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific guidelines for the format or structure of the comments? For example, should they be in a particular syntax or format, or should they include specific information such as variable names, function names, etc.?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
