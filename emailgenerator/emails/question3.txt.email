  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was going through the syllabus and have a few questions regarding the assignments.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could clarify the weightage of assignments in the course. The syllabus mentions that assignments are worth 50% of the total grade, but it would be helpful to know the exact percentage breakdown for each assignment.

Secondly, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that late assignments will receive reduced credit. Could you please provide more details on what constitutes a late assignment and what the reduction in credit will be?

Lastly, I was curious to know if there are any specific guidelines or templates that we should follow while writing comments for our code. The syllabus mentions that well-documented code with useful comments will receive full credit, but it would be helpful to have some specific guidance on what makes a comment useful.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
