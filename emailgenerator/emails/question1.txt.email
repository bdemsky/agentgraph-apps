  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1, it is mentioned that programs must be well documented with useful comments. However, I am not sure what constitutes "useful" comments. Could you please provide some guidance on what you expect in terms of commenting code?

Additionally, in section 4.2, it is stated that Android is the platform used for this course. I was wondering if you could provide some more information on what software and tools we will be using in the course, and if there are any specific requirements for the assignments in terms of programming languages or development environments.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
