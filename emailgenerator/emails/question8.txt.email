  Subject: Question on Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question regarding the assignments. Specifically, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the format and content of the assignments.

In section 4.2 of the syllabus, it mentions that all assignments must be turned in on time and late assignments will not be graded. I was wondering if you could clarify what constitutes "on time" and what the consequences are for late submissions. Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific guidelines or requirements for the structure and organization of the assignments, such as naming conventions or file format.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
