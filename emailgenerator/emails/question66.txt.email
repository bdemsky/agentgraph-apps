  Subject: Question about Midterm Exam in Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. As I was reviewing the syllabus, I noticed that there will be a midterm exam worth 10% of the final grade. I was wondering if you could provide some more details about the midterm exam, such as the format, the topics that will be covered, and the date it will be held.

Additionally, I was curious to know if there will be any optional review sessions before the midterm exam, or if there are any recommended textbooks or resources that I can use to prepare.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
