  Subject: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency course this spring. I have a few questions regarding the assignments in the syllabus.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the format of the assignments. Will they be individual or group assignments? And will they be submitted through the course website or through a separate platform?

Secondly, I noticed that you mentioned that the course slides will be posted in a Google Drive folder. Could you please provide the link to access them? I want to review them before the course begins.

Lastly, I was curious to know if there are any specific tools or software that we will be using for the assignments. I want to make sure I have them installed and configured on my computer before the course starts.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
