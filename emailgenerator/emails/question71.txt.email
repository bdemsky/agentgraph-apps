  Subject: Question about Software Failures in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your EECS 221 course, Program Analysis. I am reaching out to you regarding the section on software failures in the syllabus. I am particularly interested in understanding the impact of software failures in different industries and how they can lead to significant financial losses.

Could you please provide some examples of software failures in different domains, such as aviation, healthcare, or finance? I am also curious to know if there are any specific case studies or research papers that you would recommend reading to gain a deeper understanding of this topic?

Additionally, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the statement you made in the syllabus about software failures causing significant financial losses. How much do software failures actually cost the economy each year, and what are some of the most expensive software failures in history?

Thank you for your time and expertise, and I look forward to discussing this topic further in class.

Best regards,

John Smith
