  Subject: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know more about the late penalty policy for projects and how to handle situations where one partner does most of the work.

As per the syllabus, late penalties for projects are calculated based on the number of days late, with a deduction of 5% for the first three days, 8% from three to seven days, and 10% until the end of the quarter. However, the syllabus does not provide clear guidance on how to handle situations where one partner does most of the work.

Could you please clarify the late penalty policy for assignments and provide some guidance on how to handle situations where one partner does most of the work? I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

John Smith
