  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I was wondering if you could clarify the weightage of assignments in the course. According to the syllabus, assignments are worth 50% of the total course grade, but it would be helpful to know the exact percentage breakdown for each assignment.

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how to approach the assignments. I want to make sure I am completing them to the best of my abilities and making the most of my time in the course.

Thank you for your time and help. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
