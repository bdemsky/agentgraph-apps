  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was going through the syllabus and have a question regarding the assignments.

In section 4.1, it is mentioned that assignments must be well documented with useful comments. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean by "useful comments"? How detailed should the comments be? Should they include explanations of the code or just basic documentation?

Additionally, I was curious to know if there are any specific formatting guidelines for the comments? Should they be in a particular format, such as XML or YAML?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
