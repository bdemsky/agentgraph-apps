  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221 - Program Analysis

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am enrolled in your EECS 221 course - Program Analysis this spring. I am writing to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know the format and weightage of the assignments, as well as any additional details regarding the programming assignments and written assignments.

From the syllabus, I understand that the assignments will be worth 60% of my final grade, and I am eager to make sure I complete them to the best of my abilities. I am also curious to know if there are any restrictions on collaboration for the assignments, as I would like to work with my peers on certain tasks.

Additionally, I am interested to know if there are any resources available to help me prepare for the final examination, which is worth 30% of my grade. I am eager to do well in the course and want to make sure I am fully prepared for the exam.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

John Smith
