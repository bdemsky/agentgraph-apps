  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring. I was going through the syllabus and have a few questions regarding the assignments.

Could you please provide more details on the type of programming assignments and written assignments that will be included in the course? Are they meant to be completed individually or in groups? Also, how will the assignments be graded, and what is the weightage given to each assignment in the final grade?

Additionally, I wanted to know if there are any specific tools or programming languages that we are expected to use for the assignments? And finally, are there any resources available for students who may need help with the assignments, such as tutoring or study groups?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
