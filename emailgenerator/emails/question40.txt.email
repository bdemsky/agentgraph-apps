  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a few questions regarding the assignments.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the weightage of assignments in the course. The syllabus mentions that assignments are worth 50% of the total grade, but I am not sure if that includes the midterm and final examinations as well. Could you please clarify?

Secondly, I was curious to know if it is possible to submit assignments late without incurring any penalties. I understand that late assignments will receive reduced credit, but I have a valid reason for requesting an extension. Could you please let me know if there are any exceptions to this rule?

Lastly, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that the assignments must be submitted to the group's CVS repository. What exactly does this mean? Do I need to create a new repository for my group, or can we use an existing one? Also, are there any specific instructions on how to submit the assignments to the repository?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
