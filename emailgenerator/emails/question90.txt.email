  Subject: Clarification on Homework Assignments in COMPSCI 295

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 class. I am reaching out to seek clarification on the homework assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know if there are any specific tools or software that we are expected to use for the coding projects related to concurrent data structures.

As per the syllabus, it is mentioned that we will be exploring lock-free and wait-free data structures in the class. However, I am not sure what specific tools or software we will be using to implement these data structures. Will we be using any specific programming languages or frameworks, or can we choose our own tools?

Additionally, are there any specific guidelines or requirements for the homework assignments related to concurrent data structures? For instance, are we expected to submit the complete implementation of the data structures, or just the code for specific functionalities?

I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on these points. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

John Smith
