  Subject: Question about Lectures in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I was going through the syllabus and noticed that the lectures are scheduled to start on Tuesday and Thursday from 8:00-9:20am in RH104, and also via Zoom. My question is, will the lectures be recorded and posted online for those who cannot attend the live sessions?

I understand that attendance is mandatory, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I might miss some of the lectures. Having the recorded lectures available would be incredibly helpful in keeping up with the course material.

Please let me know if this is possible, and if so, how I can access the recorded lectures. I appreciate your time and consideration in this matter.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
