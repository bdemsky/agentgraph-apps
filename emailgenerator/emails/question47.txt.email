  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student enrolled in your EECS 114 course this semester. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question regarding the assignments.

Could you please clarify the weightage of the assignments in the course? I noticed that it is listed as 50% in the syllabus, but I want to make sure I understand the breakdown correctly. Additionally, are there any specific guidelines or requirements for the assignments beyond "well-documented with useful comments"?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
