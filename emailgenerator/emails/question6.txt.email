  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was going through the syllabus and have a question regarding the assignments. Specifically, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the format and requirements for the assignments.

I understand that the assignments are worth 50% of the total grade, and I want to make sure that I am completing them correctly. Could you please let me know if there are any specific file formats or programming languages that we need to use for the assignments? Additionally, are there any specific guidelines or rubrics that you will be using to evaluate the assignments?

I appreciate your time and help with this matter. Thank you in advance for your response.

Sincerely,
John Smith
