Subject: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to ask about the assignments in the syllabus for EECS 221: Program Analysis. I was wondering if you could provide some clarification on the following points:

1. What types of assignments can we expect to receive throughout the course? Will they be programming assignments, written assignments, or a combination of both?
2. Are there any specific topics or areas of focus that we should concentrate on when completing the assignments?
3. Is there a specific format or structure that we should follow when submitting our assignments?
4. Are there any resources or tools available to help us complete the assignments, such as debugging tools or code visualization tools?

I'm excited to get started on the course and would appreciate any guidance you can provide on these matters. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

John Smith
