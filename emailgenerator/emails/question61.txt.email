Subject: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to ask for clarification on a few points regarding assignments in the syllabus for Computer Science 142A. As a reminder, my name is John Smith and I'm a student in the course.

Firstly, I was wondering if it's possible to submit assignments as a git repository? I'm used to working with git and find it easier to manage my code that way. If this is not possible, is there an alternative way to submit my work?

Secondly, I noticed that the syllabus states that late penalties will be applied to assignments submitted beyond the deadline. I was wondering if there is a specific deadline for each assignment, or if the deadline is the same for all assignments?

Lastly, I was curious to know if we will be graded on the quality of our code or the speed at which we complete the assignments. I want to make sure I allocate my time accordingly and ensure that I'm meeting the standards expected of me.

Thanks in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
