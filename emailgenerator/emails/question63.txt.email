  Subject: Questions about Assignments in the Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am one of the students enrolled in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am writing to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know more about the expectations for late assignments and the grading policy for both partners.

As per the syllabus, late penalties will be applied to projects submitted beyond the specified deadlines. However, I couldn't find any information on the grading policy for assignments submitted late. Will the partners receive separate grades for each assignment, or will there be a combined grade for both partners?

Additionally, I was curious to know if there are any specific tools or techniques that you prefer we use for developing our compiler? The syllabus mentions that we can use any programming language we prefer, but I want to make sure I'm on the right track.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
