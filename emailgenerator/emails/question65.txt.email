  Subject: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am writing to ask about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I have a few questions regarding the expectations for each assignment and the grading criteria.

Firstly, I would like to know if it is okay to work with a partner on the assignments? I understand that both partners should contribute equally to each assignment, but I would like to clarify the expectations around collaboration.

Additionally, I am curious about the grading criteria for each assignment. How will you evaluate our work, and what constitutes a satisfactory submission? Will you be looking for originality and creativity in our solutions, or will you mainly be evaluating our understanding of the course material?

Finally, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that late penalties will be applied for projects submitted beyond the deadline. Could you provide more information on the late penalty policy and how it will be enforced?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
