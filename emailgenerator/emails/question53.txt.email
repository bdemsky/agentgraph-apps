  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was going through the syllabus and have a few questions regarding the assignments in the course.

Firstly, I would like to know if there are any specific guidelines for writing comments in the programs we submit for the assignments? I know that excessive, insufficient, or useless comments will result in deducted points, but I would like to make sure I am fully aware of what is expected of me.

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide some clarification on the platform requirement for the assignments. I understand that Sun Solaris is the standard platform used for the course, but I was wondering if it would be possible to use other platforms to develop and test our programs? If so, are there any specific requirements or restrictions that I should be aware of?

Finally, I would like to know if there are any specific instructions or guidelines for submitting assignments electronically while logged into the server? I want to make sure I am submitting my work correctly and on time.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
