Subject: Question about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to ask for some clarification on the assignments in the syllabus for Computer Science 142A. I was reviewing the course materials and have a few questions regarding the assignments.

Firstly, I was wondering if it's possible to turn in assignments late without incurring any penalty? I understand that late penalties are mentioned in the syllabus, but I'd like to confirm if there are any exceptions or alternatives for submitting assignments beyond the deadline.

Secondly, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that assignments should be submitted as a git repository. Could you please clarify what this means? Do we need to create a new repository for each assignment, or can we use an existing one? Also, how should we structure the repository?

Lastly, I was wondering if there are any resources or guidance available for completing the assignments? I know that the course lectures and slides will be recorded and posted, but are there any additional resources or tutorials that can help us understand the concepts better?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
