  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your EECS 114 course this semester. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I was wondering if you could clarify the instructions for submitting assignments electronically while logged into the server. How do I go about submitting my code and any written documentation, and what are the specific requirements for commenting code?

I want to make sure I'm following the proper procedures to ensure I receive full credit for my assignments. Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
