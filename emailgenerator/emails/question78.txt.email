  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring. I was going through the syllabus and I have a question regarding the assignments.

In section 8 of the syllabus, it is mentioned that the course will have programming assignments and/or written assignments, and these assignments will count for 60% of the final grade. However, I couldn't find any detailed information on what these assignments will entail or how they will be graded. Could you please provide some more details on what we can expect in terms of assignments?

Additionally, are there any specific topics or areas of focus that you would like us to cover in our assignments? I am eager to get started on them and want to make sure I am on the right track.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
