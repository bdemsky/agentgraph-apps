  Subject: Questions about Midterm in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I was going through the syllabus, and I have a few questions regarding the midterm.

Firstly, could you please clarify the date and time of the midterm? I want to make sure I mark it in my calendar accordingly. Additionally, could you provide some details about the format of the midterm? Will it be a written exam, a take-home assignment, or a combination of both?

Furthermore, are there any specific topics or concepts that we will be covering during the midterm? I want to make sure I review those areas before the exam.

Lastly, is there any additional resources or study materials that you recommend for preparing for the midterm?

Thank you for your time and assistance, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
