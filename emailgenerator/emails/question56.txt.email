  Subject: Question about Assignments in the Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know if it is acceptable to submit assignments as a single commit in the git repository, and if so, will it affect the grade I receive?

Additionally, the syllabus states that both partners should contribute equally to each assignment. However, I am unsure of what this means in terms of the grading criteria. Will each partner receive a separate grade, or will the grade be combined?

Lastly, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that assignments will be submitted as a git repository. Will we be required to use a specific repository format, or can we use any git repository?

Thank you for your time and clarification on these matters. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
