  Subject: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus for Computer Science 142A

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know more about the formatting and submission requirements for the assignments.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to structure and submit the assignments? For instance, should we commit each assignment as we develop it, or should we wait until the end to commit everything? Are there any specific formatting or organization requirements for the commits?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific tools or platforms that you prefer us to use for submitting the assignments?

Thank you in advance for your time and clarification. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
