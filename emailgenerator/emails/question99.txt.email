  Subject: Question about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency class this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the homework assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the format and any specific requirements or guidelines for completing the assignments.

As you mentioned in the syllabus, the assignments will be due on certain dates and will be automatically graded by an automated tool. I was wondering if you could provide more details on the tool and how it works, as well as any specific instructions or guidelines for formatting and submitting the assignments.

Additionally, I noticed that you mentioned that each assignment must contain a statement certifying that the work is the student's own and that no code was copied from any other person or source. I was wondering if you could provide any additional information on what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it in our assignments.

Thank you for your time and guidance. I am looking forward to a productive and informative course this spring.

Best regards,

John Smith
