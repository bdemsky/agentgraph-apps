  Subject: Question about Concurrent Course Material

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am enrolled in your COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about some of the course material, specifically the section on concurrent data structures.

I am having trouble understanding the concept of lock-free and wait-free data structures and would love some clarification on these topics. Could you please provide some additional resources or references that I can review to help deepen my understanding?

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how to approach the coding projects for this course. I am excited to work on these projects and would like to make sure I am on the right track.

Thank you for your time and expertise, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

John Smith
