  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course. I was going through the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. In section 4.1, it states that programs must be well documented with useful comments. Can you please clarify what you mean by "useful comments"? Do you want us to include comments for every line of code, or just for the main functions and methods?

Additionally, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that late assignments will receive reduced credit. Can you please provide more information on what constitutes a late assignment? Are we allowed to submit assignments up to a certain time after the original deadline, or do we have to submit them before the next class?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
John Smith
