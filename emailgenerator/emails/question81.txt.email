  Subject: Question about Homework in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 221 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the homework assignments.

In section 8 of the syllabus, it is mentioned that the homeworks/projects will count for 60% of the total grade. Could you please provide more details on what the homework assignments will entail? Will they be individual or group work? How many assignments are there in total? Are there any specific topics or areas of focus that we should be concentrating on?

Additionally, is there any flexibility in case we encounter any difficulties in completing an assignment due to unforeseen circumstances?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
