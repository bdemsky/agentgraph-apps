  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student enrolled in your EECS 221 course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the assignments in the course syllabus. Specifically, I have a few questions about the homework and programming assignments:

1. Are there any specific tools or languages that we are required to use for the assignments?
2. Do the assignments involve working in groups, or are they individual projects?
3. Are there any specific deadlines for submitting assignments, or can we submit them at any time during the week?
4. Can you provide any hints or tips on how to approach the assignments, especially for those that involve programming?

I am excited to learn more about program analysis and related topics in your course, and I appreciate your time and expertise in addressing my questions.

Thank you,

John Smith
