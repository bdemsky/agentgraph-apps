  Subject: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A class this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I have a few questions about the expectations for each assignment and the grading criteria.

Could you please provide more details on what the assignments are expected to cover and how they will be graded? For example, what constitutes a "significant disparity in work between the partners" in the case of a collaborative assignment? How will the assignments be submitted, and what is the penalty for late submissions?

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide any guidance on how to approach the assignments, particularly the ones that involve developing a simplified compiler. I am excited to learn more about compilers and interpreters, but I want to make sure I am on the right track with my assignments.

Thank you in advance for your time and expertise. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
