  Sure, here's an example email that John Smith could send to the professor:

Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to inquire about the assignments in EECS 114, specifically the ones listed in the syllabus. I was wondering if you could provide more detailed instructions on how to submit them electronically while logged into the server. I'm having some trouble understanding the process and would appreciate any clarification you can offer.

Additionally, I was curious to know if there are any specific requirements for the format or structure of the assignments. For example, should they be in a particular programming language or format?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
