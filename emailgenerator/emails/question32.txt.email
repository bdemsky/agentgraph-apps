  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. In section 4.1, it is mentioned that assignments must be well documented with useful comments. How detailed should the comments be? Should they include a brief explanation of what the code is doing, or should they be more detailed and cover all aspects of the code?

Additionally, are there any specific requirements for the format of the comments? Should they be in a particular style or format?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
