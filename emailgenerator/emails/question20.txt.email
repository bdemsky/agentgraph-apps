  Sure, here's an email from John Smith to the professor regarding homework in the syllabus:

Subject: Homework Questions

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to ask a few questions about the homework assignments in the syllabus for your EECS 221 course. I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the format and scope of the assignments, and I was hoping you could provide some clarification.

Firstly, I'm not sure if I'm understanding the weightage of the assignments correctly. The syllabus mentions that homeworks/projects will count for 60% of the final grade, but it doesn't specify how many assignments there will be or how long they should be. Could you please provide more details on the number of assignments and the recommended length?

Secondly, I'm unclear on the type of programming languages we'll be using for the assignments. The syllabus mentions "programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and MATLAB" but it doesn't specify which languages we should focus on. Will we be using a specific language for each assignment, or can we choose any of the listed languages?

Lastly, I was wondering if there are any specific topics or areas of focus that we should cover in our assignments. The syllabus mentions that we'll be reading research papers in class and completing assignments, but it doesn't provide any specific guidance on what those assignments should cover.

Thank you for your time and assistance, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
