  Sure, here's an example email that John Smith could send to the professor:

Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course this semester. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1, it is mentioned that assignments must be turned in on time and late assignments may not be graded. Can you please clarify what constitutes a late assignment? Are we allowed to turn in assignments up to a certain time after the deadline, or must they be submitted exactly on the due date?

Additionally, in section 4.2, it is mentioned that all course work will be checked and graded on the server. Can you please clarify what is meant by "course work"? Does this include assignments, quizzes, and/or exams?

Thank you in advance for your time and clarification. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
