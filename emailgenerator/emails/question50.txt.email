  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I am curious about the format and requirements for the assignments. Will they be individual or group assignments? Are there any specific guidelines for the structure and organization of the code?

I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on this matter. I want to make sure I understand the expectations for the assignments and can complete them to the best of my ability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
John Smith
