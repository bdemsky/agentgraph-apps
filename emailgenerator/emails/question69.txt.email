  Subject: Questions on Assignments in Computer Science 142A

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your Computer Science 142A course this spring. I am reaching out to inquire about the assignments in the syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know if it is possible to turn in assignments as a git repository, and if so, what is the preferred format for submitting them?

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how to approach the assignments in a way that ensures both partners receive similar grades. As you mentioned in the syllabus, it is important that both partners contribute equally to each assignment.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
