  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am a student in your EECS 114 course. I was reviewing the syllabus and had a question about the assignments.

In section 4.1, it states that assignments must be turned in on time, and late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. Can you please clarify what is considered late? Are there any grace periods or extensions available?

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the types of assignments we can expect throughout the course. Are they primarily programming assignments, or will there be other types of assignments as well?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
John Smith
