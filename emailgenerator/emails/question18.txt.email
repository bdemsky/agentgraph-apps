  Subject: Question about Homework in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 221 course this spring. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the homework assignments. Specifically, I am curious about the weightage of homeworks in the overall grade and the format of the assignments.

From the syllabus, I understand that homeworks will count for 60% of the total grade, but I am not sure how many assignments there will be and what the format of the assignments will be. Will they be individual or group assignments? Will they involve programming or be more theoretical in nature?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific tools or software that we will be using for the homeworks? I want to make sure I have the necessary tools installed on my computer before starting the assignments.

Please let me know if there is any additional information you can provide me. I am looking forward to a productive and informative course.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

John Smith
