  Subject: Homework Query for EECS 221 Program Analysis Course

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student enrolled in your EECS 221 Program Analysis course this spring. I am writing to inquire about the homework assignments in the course syllabus. Specifically, I would like to know if there are any specific guidelines or requirements for completing the homework, such as the format or structure of the assignments, any specific tools or software that need to be used, and any deadlines for submitting the assignments.

I am eager to get started on the homework and want to make sure I understand the expectations for the course. Could you please provide me with some guidance on this matter? I can be reached at [Your Email Address] or [Your Phone Number] if you prefer to communicate through those channels.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

John Smith
