  Subject: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221

Dear Professor Demsky,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 221 course, Program Analysis. I hope this email finds you well. I was going through the syllabus and I have a few questions regarding the assignments in the course.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the type of assignments we will be working on throughout the semester. Will they be programming assignments, written assignments, or a combination of both? Are there any specific topics or areas of focus that we should concentrate on when completing the assignments?

Additionally, I was curious to know if there are any specific tools or software that we are expected to use for the assignments? For example, will we be using any specific programming languages or debugging tools?

Lastly, I wanted to inquire about the grading policy for the assignments. How will they be weighted in the overall grade? Will there be any penalties for late submissions, and if so, how much?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Best regards,

John Smith
