  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently reviewed. I was unable to find the answer to my question within the syllabus, and I was wondering if you could provide clarification.

My question is regarding the use of Ed Discussion for the course. According to the syllabus, Ed Discussion will be used as a forum for course-related content, discussing and learning about related things, and getting assistance. However, the syllabus also states that "Off-topic discussion, memes, cyber-bullying, negativity, or hurtful behavior will not be tolerated." My question is, what specifically constitutes off-topic discussion, and how will the course staff determine whether a post is inappropriate?

I understand that this is a detail-oriented course, and I want to make sure I am aware of any expectations for using Ed Discussion. I appreciate your time and attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response.

Thank you,

[Your Name]
