  Subject: Questions about ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding the ICS 45C syllabus that I recently received. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I have a few questions that I could not find the answers to after careful review.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the pre-recorded videos that will be available for certain lecture material. How will these videos be made available, and will they be mandatory to watch?

Secondly, I am curious about the online decorum expected of us throughout the quarter. Could you provide more details on what constitutes offensive behavior or disrespectful conduct, and what consequences we can expect if we violate these expectations?

Lastly, I was wondering if you could provide more information on the grading criteria for the programming projects and reinforcement exercises. How will the weights of each assignment be determined, and what are the minimum scores required to pass the course?

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
