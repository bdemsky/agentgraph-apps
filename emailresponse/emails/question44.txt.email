  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding the ICS 46 syllabus for the upcoming quarter. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have a question that cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely.

My question is: Are there any recommended resources or texts that you would recommend for students to use outside of the course to supplement their learning? Specifically, I am interested in learning more about C++ programming beyond what is covered in the course.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
