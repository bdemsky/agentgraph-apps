Subject: Clarification on Course Syllabus

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course, but I have a question that I couldn't find the answer to within the syllabus itself. I apologize in advance if the information is there and I somehow missed it.

Regarding the lab meetings, it states in the syllabus that there are no scheduled lab sections, but there will be in-person lab meetings on selected days and times throughout the week. I couldn't find any specific information regarding the timing and location of these lab meetings. Could you please provide some clarity on this?

Additionally, I would like to know if attendance at these lab meetings is required or if they are optional for students. If attendance is required, will it be graded?

Thank you for your assistance in clearing up these doubts. I appreciate your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
