  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Requirements and Policies

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few aspects of the ICS 45C course syllabus, which I recently received. As I go through the syllabus, I have some questions regarding the course format, equipment requirements, grading policies, and academic honesty expectations.

1. Course Format: The syllabus mentions that the course is primarily in-person, with some online elements. Can you provide more details on the online components, such as the role of online spaces (e.g., Canvas course space, Zoom meetings), and how they will be used throughout the quarter?
2. Equipment Requirements: The syllabus states that a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam and microphone is required. Are there any specific requirements for the laptop/desktop, such as minimum processor speed or RAM? Additionally, will we be required to have a stable internet connection for online video content and discussions?
3. Grading Policies: I am interested in understanding the weightage of each graded component (e.g., programming projects, reinforcement exercises, Final Exam) and how they will be assessed. Will there be any opportunities for re-submission or re-evaluation of assignments if we encounter any issues?
4. Academic Honesty: The syllabus highlights the importance of academic honesty and provides a link to the UCI Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct policies. Can you elaborate on what constitutes academic dishonesty in this course and what the consequences will be if we violate these policies?

Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing my questions. I look forward to a productive quarter in ICS 45C.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
