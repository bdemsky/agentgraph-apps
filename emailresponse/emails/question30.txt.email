Subject: Clarification on Course Policies

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read the syllabus for the course, and I appreciate the thorough information provided. Overall, it seems like a well-organized and engaging course. However, I do have a specific question regarding one of the policies mentioned.

In the section on "Weights of graded artifacts," it is mentioned that the Final Exam accounts for 30% of the overall grade. I was wondering if you could clarify how the Final Exam will be conducted. Will it be an in-person exam or an online exam? Additionally, will the exam be cumulative and cover all the topics discussed throughout the quarter?

Thank you for taking the time to address my question. I appreciate your assistance in providing clarification on this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
