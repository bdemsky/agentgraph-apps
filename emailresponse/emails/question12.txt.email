Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for the course and I appreciate the detailed information provided. However, I still have a question regarding the lab sessions.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that attendance at the lab sessions is not required, but it is recommended. I understand that the labs will not be graded this quarter, but I was wondering if attending the lab sessions would still be beneficial for my learning and understanding of the course material. Are the TAs and LAs available during the lab sessions to provide assistance and feedback on our work, even though it will not be graded?

Thank you for your time and clarification. I look forward to starting the course.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
