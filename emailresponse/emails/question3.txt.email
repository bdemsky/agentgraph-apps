Subject: Clarification on Course Format and Online Requirements

Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have read the syllabus for the course and I have a question regarding the course format and online requirements.

Based on the syllabus, I understand that the course will be predominantly in-person. However, it mentions that there will be pre-recorded videos available for officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space. I wanted to confirm if these pre-recorded videos are optional or if they are expected to be watched in addition to attending the in-person lectures. Would my understanding be correct in that watching the videos and attending the lectures are both important for the full learning experience of the course?

Additionally, the syllabus mentions the use of online platforms such as Canvas, Zoom, Ed Discussion, and YuJa. I wanted to inquire about the specific functionalities of each platform in relation to the course. Are these platforms primarily used for accessing lecture recordings, submitting assignments, participating in online meetings, and engaging in course discussions? It would be helpful to have a better understanding of how these platforms will be utilized throughout the course.

I truly appreciate your help in clarifying these aspects of the course. Thank you for taking the time to address my questions. I am looking forward to a productive and engaging quarter.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
