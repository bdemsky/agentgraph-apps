  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus for the current quarter. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have a question regarding the grading policies for the course.

Specifically, I am curious about the criteria for grading exams. The syllabus states that exams will be weighted equally and that the overall passing average in the course is 60%. However, it does not provide any details on how the exams will be graded or what factors will be considered when calculating the grade.

Could you please provide more information on the grading criteria for exams in CompSci 161? I understand that it is important to follow the syllabus policies, but I want to make sure I am fully aware of the grading requirements for the course.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
