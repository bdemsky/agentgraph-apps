  Subject: Questions on Course Syllabus for ICS 32A

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request clarification on a few points regarding the course syllabus for ICS 32A, which I recently received. I have closely read the syllabus, but I would appreciate further guidance on the following:

1. In-person format: The syllabus mentions that the course is primarily an in-person offering, but it also includes some online elements. Can you provide more details on the balance between in-person and online learning, and how the two will be integrated?
2. Equipment requirements: The syllabus lists a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam and microphone as necessary equipment for participation. Are there any specific requirements for the laptop/desktop computer, such as operating system or hardware specifications?
3. Pre-recorded videos: The syllabus mentions that some lecture material will be pre-recorded and made available online. How will these videos be accessed, and will they be mandatory to watch?
4. Online decorum: The syllabus emphasizes the importance of maintaining a respectful and professional online environment. Can you provide more details on what constitutes appropriate behavior and decorum in online spaces?
5. Reinforcement exercises: The syllabus mentions that there will be seven lab sections, and that attendance in these sections is required. How will the lab sections be staffed, and what kind of support can students expect to receive in these sections?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
