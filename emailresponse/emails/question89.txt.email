  Subject: Questions about the ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding the ICS 45C syllabus that I recently received. As I am preparing to start the course, I have a few questions that I hope you can clarify.

Firstly, I am unclear about the format of the course. Will it be primarily in-person, or will there be any online components? Additionally, are there any scheduled lab meetings available throughout the week?

Secondly, I noticed that the course requires no textbook, and instead, you will provide a complete set of Notes and Examples covering every lecture this quarter. Can you please provide some more information about these Notes and Examples, such as their level of detail and how they will be organized?

Lastly, I am interested in knowing more about the grading structure of the course. What are the weights of each graded artifact, and how will the decorum requirements affect my grade?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
