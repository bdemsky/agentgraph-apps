Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for our course, and I have a question regarding the attendance policy for the Final Exam.

In the syllabus, it states that attendance at the Final Exam is a required part of our enrollment in the course. I understand that the date and time for the exam are listed in the Schedule, and it is our responsibility to keep our schedule clear and arrive at the exam on time. However, I was wondering if there are any circumstances under which a rescheduled exam could be arranged?

Thank you for your clarification on this matter. I appreciate your time and attention to my question.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
