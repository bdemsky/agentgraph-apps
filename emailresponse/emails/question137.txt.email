  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus for the current quarter. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have a question regarding the grading policies for the course.

Specifically, I am curious about the weighting of assignments and exams in the course. The syllabus mentions that the course will be graded based on the following categories: warm-up exercises, three mid-quarter topic exams, and demonstrated competency of core topics at exams. However, the syllabus does not provide a breakdown of the percentage of points allocated to each category.

Could you please provide me with the percentage breakdown of the grading categories, or direct me to a document that provides this information? I would greatly appreciate it if you could answer my question as soon as possible, as I am eager to start the course and plan my studying accordingly.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
