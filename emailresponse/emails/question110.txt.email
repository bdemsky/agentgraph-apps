  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that I cannot answer by reading the syllabus closely. In the section on "Reinforcement Exercises," it is mentioned that we will be releasing reinforcement exercises "roughly corresponding to each week's lecture material." My question is, will these reinforcement exercises be available for us to complete at any time during the week, or will they be released at specific times?

Additionally, will we be provided with any guidance or instructions on how to approach these reinforcement exercises, or will we be expected to figure them out on our own?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
