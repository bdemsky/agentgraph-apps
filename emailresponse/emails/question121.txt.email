  Subject: Questions about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I am writing to ask for clarification on a few points regarding the CompSci 161 syllabus. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I would like to confirm the following:

1. Can you provide more information on the grading weights for the mid-quarter topic exams and the demonstrated competency of core topics at exams? How will these weights be adjusted if remote instruction is reinstated?
2. What constitutes an acceptable privacy setting for posting questions on EdStem? Will you ignore posts that are not privacy set to instructors only?
3. How do I submit a regrade request for an exam question that I believe was incorrectly graded? What are the requirements for submitting a regrade request, and what happens if I fail to include a description of why I believe the artifact was incorrectly graded?
4. Are there any specific instructions for contacting course staff other than the professor about the class? What are the email filters in place for emails sent to the professor
