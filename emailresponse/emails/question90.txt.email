  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Organization and Assignments

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on some points regarding the course syllabus for ICS 45C, which I recently received. As I go through the syllabus, I have a few questions that arise, and I would appreciate your help in addressing them.

Firstly, I am curious about the format of the course. The syllabus mentions that the course will be administered in a predominantly in-person format, but it does not elaborate on the specific arrangements for online learning. Could you provide more details on the online components of the course, such as any required virtual meetings or assignments?

Secondly, I am unsure about the weightage of the different assignments in the course. The syllabus mentions that the final exam will be worth 30% of the overall grade, but it does not provide the same breakdown for the other assignments. Could you please provide a detailed breakdown of the weightage for each assignment?

Lastly, I have a question regarding the policy on academic honesty. The syllabus mentions that all work must be completed solely by the student, and any violations of academic honesty policies will result in consequences. Could you provide more information on what constitutes academic dishonesty and the possible consequences?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
