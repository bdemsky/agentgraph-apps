Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for providing us with the syllabus for the course. I have carefully read through it and I have a question that I could not find an answer to within the syllabus.

Regarding the reinforcement exercises, I understand that they contribute to our grade, but I was wondering how they will be assessed. Will they be graded based on completion or will there be specific criteria for grading?

Thank you for your clarification. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
