  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request clarification on a specific aspect of the course syllabus for ICS 46. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have a question regarding the online participation and decorum requirements.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that "While it is not our intent to measure your participation...we reserve the right to deduct as much as 10% from a student's grade when their behavior does not follow the decorum requirements." My question is, what specifically constitutes a violation of the decorum requirements? Will the syllabus provide more details on this matter?

Additionally, I would like to know if there are any specific guidelines provided on how to report any incidents of offensive or disruptive behavior observed during online meetings or discussions.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
