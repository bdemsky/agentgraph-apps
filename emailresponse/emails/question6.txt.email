Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course, and I have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises.

In the syllabus, it states that the reinforcement exercises will contribute to our grade, but it doesn't specify how they will be graded. Could you please provide more information on how the reinforcement exercises will be assessed?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
