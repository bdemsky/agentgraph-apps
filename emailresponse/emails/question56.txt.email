  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that I cannot answer by reading the document closely. Specifically, I am curious about the grading policy for the in-person exams. The syllabus mentions that the exams will be held on certain days, but it does not provide any information on how the exams will be graded or what factors will be considered in determining the final grade.

Could you please provide more details on the grading policy for the in-person exams? How will the exams be graded, and what criteria will be used to determine the final grade? I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on this matter.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
