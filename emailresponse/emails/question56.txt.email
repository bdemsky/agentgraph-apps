Subject: Question about Syllabus

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for the course, but I have a question that could not be answered by reading the syllabus closely.

Regarding the in-person lab meetings, you mentioned that they will be offered on a selection of days and times throughout the week. Could you please provide more information about the specific dates and times of these lab meetings? Additionally, could you clarify the locations where these meetings will take place?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your help in clarifying this aspect of the course.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
