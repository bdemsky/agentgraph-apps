Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read the syllabus for our course and I have a question regarding the grading policy. I understand that our grades will be determined based on our scores on projects, reinforcement exercises, and the final exam. However, I was wondering if there will be any opportunities for extra credit or additional assignments to improve our grades throughout the quarter. Thank you for your clarification.

Best regards,
Emily Smith
