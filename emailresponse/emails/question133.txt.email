  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus for the current quarter. After carefully reading the syllabus, I have a question about the grading policies for the course.

Specifically, I am curious about the weight given to warm-up exercises in the course. According to the syllabus, all warm-up exercises will be weighted equally, but it is not clear how many warm-up exercises there will be throughout the quarter. Will each warm-up exercise be worth the same amount of points, or will the points allocated to each exercise vary?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any resources available for students who may need help understanding the grading policies or who may have questions about the course material.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
