  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Syllabus Points

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points from the course syllabus for ICS 45C, which I recently received. I would like to ensure that I understand the expectations and requirements for the course, especially regarding the pre-recorded videos, online participation, and grading.

Could you please provide more details on the following points:

1. Pre-recorded videos: How will these videos be made available to us? Will they be posted on the course website or through another platform?
2. Online participation: What constitutes acceptable online behavior? Are there any specific guidelines or rules that I need to follow?
3. Grading: How will the weights of the different assignments and assessments be determined? Will there be any opportunities to make up missed assignments or exams?

I understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, and I appreciate your flexibility in addressing any issues that may arise during the course.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
