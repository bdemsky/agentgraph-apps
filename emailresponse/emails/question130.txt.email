  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Syllabus Points

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points mentioned in the course syllabus for CompSci 161 Winter 2024. As I thoroughly read through the document, I have some questions that cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely.

Firstly, I would like to know more about the "In-Person Exam Logistics and Rules" document mentioned in the syllabus. Could you provide a link to access the document or provide more details on how to access it?

Secondly, under the "Grade calculation" section, it is mentioned that the relative weighting of assignments is based on the assumption that in-person instruction remains for the quarter. However, if remote instruction is reinstated by the university, will the weights of the assignments change? Could you provide more information on how the weights will be adjusted in such a scenario?

Lastly, I am curious to know more about the "Academic Honesty Policy"
