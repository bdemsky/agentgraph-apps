Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course, ICS 32A, and I have a question regarding the pre-recorded videos.

In the syllabus, it states that portions of the lecture material will be pre-recorded and available to officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space. I understand that attendance is not graded, but I would like to clarify whether watching the pre-recorded videos is required or recommended for this course. Will the content covered in the videos be the same as the material presented in the in-person lectures?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
