  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request clarification on a specific aspect of the course syllabus for ICS 46. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have a question that cannot be answered by reading the document closely.

My question is regarding the portion of the syllabus that outlines the grading criteria for the course. Specifically, I am curious about the weightage of each component of the grade (e.g., programming projects, reinforcement exercises, final exam) and how they are combined to determine the overall grade. Could you please provide more details on this aspect of the grading system?

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
