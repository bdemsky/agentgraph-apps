Subject: ICS32A: Grading Policy Concern
Body:
Hi Professor:

My name is Peter Anteater and I am in your ICS32A course. I unfortunately did not do as well as I had hoped on the first assignment, and I am now concerned about the grade I will recieve in the course. I was just curious, how much does my grade on this assignment affect my overall course grade?

Thank you,
Peter Anteater
