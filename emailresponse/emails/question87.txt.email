  Subject: Seeking Clarification on ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As I review the syllabus for ICS 45C, I have a few questions regarding the course organization and expectations. I would greatly appreciate your clarification on the following points:

1. In-person format: Can you elaborate on the in-person format of the course? Will there be any scheduled meetings or lectures that I am required to attend in person?
2. Equipment requirements: Could you provide more details on the types of equipment needed for the course, such as a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam and microphone? Are there any specific brands or models recommended?
3. Pre-recorded videos: How will the pre-recorded videos be made available to students? Will they be posted on a specific platform or website, and how will access be granted?
4. Online participation: Can you clarify the online participation expectations? Are there any specific online spaces or tools that we are required to use for discussions, office hours, or other course-related activities?
5. Grading weights: Could you provide a breakdown of the weightage for each assessment component (programming projects, reinforcement exercises, final exam)? How will the final grade be determined, and are there any additional factors that will be taken into account?
6. Accommodations: I have a disability that may require accommodations in the course. How should I proceed to request accommodations, and what is the process for arranging them?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
