  Subject: Questions on the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask some questions regarding the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I would like to clarify some points before the course begins.

My questions are:

1. What constitutes a "reasonable level of decorum" within online spaces, and what are the consequences for not meeting this standard?
2. Can you provide more details on the pre-recorded videos that will be available on YuJa, and how will they be linked to the course?
3. Are there any specific requirements for the equipment I need to have in order to participate in the course, such as a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam and microphone?
4. Are there any specific dates or times when the lab meetings will take place, and how can I find out more information about them?
5. How will the grading for the course be determined, and what are the weightings for each component (programming projects, reinforcement exercises, final exam)?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
