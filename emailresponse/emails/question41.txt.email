  Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 114 course this semester. I was going through the syllabus and have a question regarding the assignments.

In section 4.1 of the syllabus, it states that assignments must be turned in on time and late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. However, I was wondering if there are any exceptions to this rule? For example, if I were to encounter technical difficulties or illness, would I be able to submit my assignments late without penalty?

Additionally, in section 4.2 of the syllabus, it mentions that all course work will be checked and graded on the server. Can you please clarify what this means? Will I be able to submit my assignments electronically while logged into the server, or do I need to physically bring them to the server for grading?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
