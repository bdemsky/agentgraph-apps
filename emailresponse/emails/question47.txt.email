Subject: Clarification on Course Policies and Requirements

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully reviewed the syllabus for our course and I greatly appreciate the detailed information provided. However, there is one point that I would like to seek clarification on, as I was unable to find the answer in the syllabus.

Regarding the reinforcement exercises, it is mentioned that they contribute to our grade. I understand that there will be eight sets of reinforcement exercises, weighted equally at 3% each. However, I was wondering if these reinforcement exercises will be graded on a binary scale (i.e., pass/fail) or if there will be a grading rubric with specific criteria for evaluation.

Thank you for addressing this question and providing further clarification on the grading criteria for the reinforcement exercises. I want to ensure that I have a clear understanding of the expectations in order to successfully complete these exercises.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
