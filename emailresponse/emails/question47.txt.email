  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus for the upcoming quarter. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I have a few questions that are not addressed in the document.

My question is regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be available as part of the course. According to the syllabus, these videos will be available on YuJa, but it is not clear how to access them. Could you please provide more information on how to access the pre-recorded videos, or clarify whether there are any specific requirements for viewing them?

Additionally, I was wondering if there are any specific guidelines for attending the in-person lectures and lab meetings. The syllabus mentions that attendance is not graded, but it is not clear whether attendance is required for all lectures and lab meetings, or if attendance is only required on certain days. Could you please provide more information on the expectations for attendance?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
