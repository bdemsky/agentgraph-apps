  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Syllabus for ICS 45C - Spring 2022

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the syllabus for ICS 45C - Introduction to Computer Systems, which I have been provided with. As a diligent student, I would like to ensure that I understand the course requirements and expectations clearly.

1. Lecture Meetings: The syllabus mentions that lectures will be held in-person on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00-6:20 pm. However, it does not specify whether attendance will be taken at these lectures. Could you please confirm whether attendance is mandatory or optional?
2. Pre-Recorded Videos: The syllabus mentions that portions of the lecture material will be pre-recorded and made available to officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space. Could you please clarify whether these pre-recorded videos will be available for all lecture topics or only select ones?
3. Online Decorum: The syllabus emphasizes the importance of maintaining a reasonable level of decorum within online spaces. Could you please provide more details on what constitutes offensive or disrespectful behavior online and what consequences may arise if these guidelines are not followed?
4. Programming Projects: The syllabus outlines the weightage of programming projects, reinforcement exercises, and the Final Exam in determining the course grade. Could you please clarify whether the projects and reinforcement exercises must be completed individually or can they be completed in groups?
5. Dropping or Changing Grade Option: The syllabus mentions that dropping or changing the grade option can be done via WebReg through the end of Week 2. Could you please provide the exact dates for these deadlines?

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
