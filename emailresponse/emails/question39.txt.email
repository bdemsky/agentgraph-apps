Subject: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear Professor Demsky and TA Jenista,

My name is John Smith and I am a student in your EECS 40 course this semester. I was reviewing the syllabus and have a question about the assignments. Specifically, I was wondering if you could clarify the weightage of the assignments in the course. According to the syllabus, 50% of the grade will come from the assignments, but it does not specify how many points each assignment is worth.

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how to approach the assignments. For example, are we expected to complete each assignment on our own, or can we work in groups? Also, are there any specific requirements for the format and organization of the code?

Thank you for your time and help. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Smith
