  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that I cannot seem to find the answer to by reading the syllabus closely.

In the section on "Pre-recorded videos," it is mentioned that some of the lecture material will be pre-recorded and made available via the Canvas course space. However, the syllabus does not provide any information on how to access these pre-recorded videos or when they will be available. Could you please provide more details on how to access these videos and when they will be available?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
