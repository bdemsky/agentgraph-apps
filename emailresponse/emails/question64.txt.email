  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Labs Section Enrollment

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a particular point regarding the ICS 32A syllabus. As I was going through the syllabus, I noticed that the labs section is mentioned, and I have a question regarding enrollment in these sections.

The syllabus states that attendance is not graded, but enrollment in the labs is required to receive TA and LA assistance. However, it also mentions that some lab sections are laptop-only sections, where there are no computers available for general use except for those brought by the students. My question is, will students be allowed to attend these laptop-only sections without a laptop? If so, how will they be able to access the materials and complete the assignments without a laptop?

I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide clarification on this matter. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
