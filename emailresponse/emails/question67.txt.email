  Subject: Questions on ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask some questions related to the ICS 32A syllabus that was provided to us. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I would appreciate some clarification on the following points:

1. What is the format of the pre-recorded videos that will be available on YuJa, and will they be available for all topics covered in the course?
2. How will we know when reinforcement exercises are available, and will they be graded?
3. Can you provide more details on the laptop/computer requirements for the course, including the specifications and software needed?
4. Are there any specific rules or guidelines for online decorum, and what are the consequences for not meeting these expectations?
5. How will attendance be taken for the in-person Final Exam, and what happens if we are unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances?

Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
