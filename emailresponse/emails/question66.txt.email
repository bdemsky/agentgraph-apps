  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Requirements - ICS 32A

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the ICS 32A course syllabus. As I carefully read through the syllabus, I have some questions that cannot be answered by reading the document closely.

Firstly, I would like to know the specific dates and times for the in-person lectures and final exam. While the syllabus mentions that the lectures will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00-6:20 pm, it does not provide the exact dates and times for the lectures and final exam. I would like to plan my schedule accordingly and ensure that I am available for all the lectures and the final exam.

Secondly, I would like to know more about the pre-recorded videos that will be available for some lectures. How will these videos be made available, and will they be required viewing for the course? I want to ensure that I am keeping up with the coursework and attending the lectures as required.

Lastly, I would like to know if there are any specific software or hardware requirements for the course. I want to ensure that my laptop or desktop computer meets the necessary requirements for the course, especially for the programming projects and reinforcement exercises.

Thank you for your time and assistance in clarifying these points. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
