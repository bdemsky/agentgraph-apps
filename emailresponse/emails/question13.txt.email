Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course, and I had a question regarding the attendance policy for the final exam. In the syllabus, it is mentioned that attendance at the final exam is required and that scheduling conflicts will not be accommodated. I was wondering if there are any exceptions to this policy for cases of extenuating circumstances, such as an illness or incapacitation. Could you please provide some clarification on this matter?

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
