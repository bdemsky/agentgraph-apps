Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. After carefully reviewing the syllabus for our course, I have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises. While it is mentioned that they contribute to our grade, I would like to know if there is a specific format or submission method for these exercises. Could you please provide some clarification on how we are expected to submit our reinforcement exercise work?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your assistance.

Best regards,
Sophia Thompson
