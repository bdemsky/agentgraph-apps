  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Requirements and Policies

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on some of the requirements and policies outlined in the course syllabus for ICS 45C, which I recently received. As a student in the course, I would like to better understand the following points:

1. Pre-recorded videos and online decorum: Can you provide more information on the type of content that will be covered in the pre-recorded videos, and how they will be made available to students? Additionally, what are the expectations for online decorum, and what consequences may students face if they violate these expectations?
2. Lab meetings: How often will lab meetings be held, and what will be the format for these meetings? Will students be required to attend any specific lab sections, or can they choose the time that works best for them?
3. Accommodations for disabilities: How can students who may need accommodations due to a disability contact you privately to discuss their specific needs? Are there any resources available on campus that can provide additional support?
4. Determining final grades: Can you provide more information on how the course grades will be determined, including the weights of each graded artifact and the criteria for deducting points for poor online participation?
5. Dropping the course or changing grade option: Can you clarify the process for dropping the course or changing the grade option through WebReg and the Enrollment Exceptions system? Are there any deadlines or requirements that students should be aware of?
6. Academic honesty: Can you provide more information on the policies and procedures in place to ensure academic honesty in the course? What are the consequences for violating these policies, and how can students report any suspected instances of academic dishonesty?

I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on these points. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
