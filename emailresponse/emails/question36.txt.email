Subject: Question about the syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have thoroughly read through the syllabus for ICS 45C and I have a question regarding the attendance policy for the lecture.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that attendance is not graded for the lecture. However, I wanted to clarify if attendance is still required for the days when exams are held. Are students required to attend those specific lectures in person?

Thank you for your clarification.

Best regards,
