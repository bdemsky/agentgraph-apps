  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Syllabus for ICS 45C - Spring 2022

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the syllabus for ICS 45C - Introduction to Computer Systems, which I recently received. As I go through the document, I have some questions that arise, and I would appreciate your input.

Firstly, under the "Lecture" section, it is mentioned that pre-recorded videos will be available for certain topics. Can you please provide more details on what topics these will cover and how I can access them? Additionally, will these videos be available throughout the quarter, or are they only available for a limited time?

Secondly, under the "Online decorum" section, it is stated that any combination of TAs and lab tutors will be available to help students with their projects and reinforcement exercises during in-person lab meetings. How can I determine which days and times these lab meetings will take place, and how can I sign up for them?

Lastly, under the "Grading" section, it is mentioned that the weight of each programming project will be 44%, with the remaining weights distributed among reinforcement exercises and the Final Exam. Can you please provide more details on what constitutes a "set-up" project and how the weights of the reinforcement exercises will be distributed?

I understand that these questions may seem straightforward, but I want to ensure that I have a clear understanding of the course requirements before the quarter begins. Your assistance in addressing these queries is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
