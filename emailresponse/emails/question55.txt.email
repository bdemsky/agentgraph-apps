  Subject: Questions about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for ICS 46 and have a few questions that can be answered by a closer reading of the document.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could clarify the format of the lecture material that will be covered in the course. The syllabus mentions that the lectures will be held in-person, but it does not provide information on whether they will be recorded or made available online. Additionally, the syllabus mentions that some lectures may be held remotely, but it does not specify how these lectures will be conducted. Could you provide more details on the format of the lecture material?

Secondly, I was curious about the role of Ed Discussion in the course. The syllabus mentions that it is a forum for course-related content, discussing and learning about related topics, and getting assistance. However, it also mentions that off-topic discussion, memes, cyber-bullying, negativity, or hurtful behavior will not be tolerated. Could you provide more details on what is expected of students in terms of behavior and participation on Ed Discussion?

Lastly, I was wondering if you could provide more information on the grading criteria for the course. The syllabus mentions that the grade will be determined from the weighted combination of programming projects, reinforcement exercises, and an in-person Final Exam. However, it does not provide information on the specific weights assigned to each component or the criteria used to evaluate the programming projects and reinforcement exercises. Could you provide more details on the grading criteria for the course?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
