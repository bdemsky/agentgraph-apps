  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that I would like to ask. I have read through the syllabus carefully, but there is something that I am unclear about.

My question is regarding the grading policy for the course. Specifically, I am wondering what happens if I miss an exam for any reason? Will I be able to retake the exam at a later date, or will the missed exam count against my grade?

Additionally, I am curious about the grading rubric for the course. Will you be providing a detailed grading rubric for each topic, or will it be more general?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
