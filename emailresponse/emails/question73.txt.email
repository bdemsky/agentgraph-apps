  Subject: Questions about the Course Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the course syllabus for ICS 32A. After careful reading, I have the following questions:

1. Under "Lecture," it is mentioned that pre-recorded videos will be available on YuJa, and some recorded videos will be part of this course. Can you provide more information on how to access these videos? Are they available through the Canvas course space as well?
2. In the "Online decorum" section, it is stated that we are expected to maintain a reasonable level of decorum within all online spaces at all times. Could you elaborate on what constitutes offensive or disrespectful behavior, both in-person and online?
3. For the reinforcement exercises, are there any specific topics or areas of focus that we should prioritize, or can we choose any topics related to the course material?
4. In the "Grading" section, the weights of graded artifacts are listed, but it is unclear how the final exam attendance policy works. Will there be any make-up exams available for students who miss the scheduled exam date?
5. Finally, under "Determining final grades," it is mentioned that overall scores above 90% will receive an A- or better, but it is unclear how the actual cutoffs may be lowered at the end of the quarter. Could you provide more information on how the final grades will be determined?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
