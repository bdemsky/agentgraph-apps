  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. My question is regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be available as part of the course.

According to the syllabus, "Pre-recorded videos will be available on YuJa, which you'll find linked through the Canvas course space." I was wondering if you could provide more information on how to access these pre-recorded videos? Will they be available through the Canvas course space only, or will they also be available through other means, such as the course website or email?

Additionally, I was curious to know if there are any specific guidelines for watching these pre-recorded videos? For example, are there any deadlines for completing them, or are they meant to be watched at the student's convenience?

Thank you for your time and assistance, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
