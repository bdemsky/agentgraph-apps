  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about the course syllabus for ICS 45C, specifically regarding the section on "Pre-recorded videos." Could you please clarify what is meant by "pre-recorded videos" in the context of the course? Will these videos be available for viewing at any time, or are there specific dates and times when they will be made available?

Additionally, I am curious about the statement regarding "Online participation and decorum." How does one ensure that they are meeting the decorum requirements, and what are the consequences for not adhering to these requirements?

Thank you in advance for your time and clarification.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
