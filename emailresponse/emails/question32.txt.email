Subject: Clarification on Academic Honesty Policy

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read the syllabus for ICS 45C and I have a question regarding the academic honesty policy.

In the syllabus, it is stated that all work on projects and reinforcement exercises should be completed solely by the student, and collaboration or sharing of code between students is strictly prohibited. However, I am unclear on the boundary between seeking help and academic dishonesty.

For example, let's say I have encountered a challenging coding problem and I seek assistance from a classmate. If my classmate explains a concept or algorithm to me, and I understand it, would it be considered academic dishonesty if I then proceed to write the solution myself based on my classmate's explanation?

Thank you for taking the time to clarify this matter. I appreciate your guidance and adherence to academic integrity.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
