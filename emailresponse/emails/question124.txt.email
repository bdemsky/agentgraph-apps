  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that I cannot seem to find an answer to by reading the document closely. I was wondering if you could provide some clarification on the following point:

In the section on "Grade calculation," it is mentioned that the following relative weighting of assignments will be used: "Artifacts due prior to that point will be weighted equally." However, the syllabus does not provide any information on what constitutes an "artifact" or how to submit one. Could you please provide more details on what types of assignments are considered "artifacts" and how to submit them?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
