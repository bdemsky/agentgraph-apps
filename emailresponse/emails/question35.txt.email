Subject: Clarification on Online Meetings and Participation

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our ICS 45C course and I have a question regarding the online meetings and participation.

In the syllabus, it mentions that Zoom will be used for any online meetings, including your office hours throughout the quarter. I just wanted to confirm whether these office hours will be held only on Zoom, or if there will be in-person office hours as well. I want to make sure I understand the format correctly and plan accordingly.

Additionally, I noticed that online participation is not specifically tracked, but there is a mention of decorum requirements for online spaces. Could you please clarify what specific actions or behaviors would be considered violations of decorum? I want to ensure that I am following the guidelines appropriately.

Thank you for your time and clarification. I appreciate your assistance in helping me understand the course structure better.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
