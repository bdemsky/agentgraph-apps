  Subject: Seeking Clarification on ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on the ICS 45C syllabus for the upcoming quarter. As I carefully read through the syllabus, I have a few questions that arose regarding the course organization, online participation, and grading policies.

Firstly, I would like to know more about the in-person format of the course. Will there be any scheduled lab meetings or office hours available for students to receive individualized help? Additionally, how will pre-recorded videos and online materials be administered throughout the quarter?

Secondly, I am curious about the online participation requirements and how they will be monitored. What constitutes acceptable online decorum, and will there be any consequences for violating these expectations?

Lastly, I would appreciate some clarification on the weightage of graded artifacts in the final grade. Will the programming projects and reinforcement exercises be graded separately, and how will they contribute to the overall course grade?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
