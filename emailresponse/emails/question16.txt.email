Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course and I have a question regarding the lab sections.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that attendance at the lab sections is not graded and that nothing will be graded in the labs this quarter. However, it is also mentioned that attendance in the lab sections offers some significant benefits such as consulting with TAs and LAs regarding our work and being able to work alongside other students facing the same problems.

Since attendance is not graded and nothing will be graded in the labs, I was wondering if it is necessary for me to attend the lab sections. Will the material covered in the labs be covered in the lectures or pre-recorded videos? Will there be any specific lab-related content that I would miss out on if I choose not to attend the lab sections?

Thank you for your clarification on this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
