  Subject: Questions about the Course Syllabus for ICS 32A

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask some questions about the course syllabus for ICS 32A, which I have reviewed carefully. I have a few concerns and questions that cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely, and I would appreciate your clarification.

Firstly, I am curious about the laptop or desktop computer requirements for the course. The syllabus mentions that a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam and microphone is necessary for participation, but it does not specify if these tools are required to be a specific brand or model. Could you provide more information on the minimum requirements for the laptop or desktop computer?

Secondly, the syllabus mentions that there are pre-recorded videos available for some of the course material, but it does not provide any details on how to access these videos. Could you provide information on how to access the pre-recorded videos and how they will be incorporated into the course?

Lastly, I am confused about the grading breakdown for the course. The syllabus states that the final grade will be determined from the weighted combination of seven programming projects, eight sets of reinforcement exercises, and an in-person Final Exam. However, it does not provide any information on the weightage of each component or how the scores from the different components will be combined. Could you provide more details on the grading breakdown and how the scores will be calculated?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
