  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on the course syllabus for ICS 45C, which I recently received. I have a few questions that cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely, and I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving them.

Firstly, I am curious about the format of the course. Will it be primarily in-person, or will there be any online components? Additionally, will there be any pre-recorded videos or lectures that we need to watch?

Secondly, I am unsure about the weightage of the graded artifacts. Could you please provide more information on the relative importance of each component of the course grade, such as programming projects, reinforcement exercises, and the Final Exam?

Lastly, I am concerned about the decorum requirements for online spaces. Can you please provide more details on what constitutes offensive behavior and how it will be enforced?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
