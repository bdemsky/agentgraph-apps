  Subject: Request for Clarification on Syllabus Points

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points mentioned in the syllabus for your course, ICS 32A. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I would appreciate some additional information on the following:

1. Lecture Attendance: The syllabus mentions that attendance is not graded, but it is recommended. Can you please clarify whether attendance is mandatory or optional? Are there any consequences for missing lectures?
2. Pre-recorded Videos: The syllabus mentions that some lecture material will be pre-recorded and available online. How will these videos be made available? Will they be linked through the course website or Canvas?
3. Reinforcement Exercises: The syllabus mentions that reinforcement exercises will be released roughly corresponding to each week's lecture material. Can you please clarify how these exercises will be submitted and graded? Will they be submitted through Canvas, and if so, how often?
4. Lab Sections: The syllabus mentions that lab sections will be laptop-only sections, and staffed with the same personal help available in the others. Can you please clarify what kind of help will be available in the labs? Will there be TAs or LAs available to answer questions?
5. Accommodations for Disabilities: The syllabus mentions that students who feel they may need an accommodation based on a disability should contact you privately. Can you please provide more information on the accommodations available and how to access them?

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
