  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Organization and Expectations

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on the course organization and expectations for ICS 45C, as outlined in the course syllabus. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but have a few questions that cannot be answered by reading it closely:

1. Can you provide more details on the pre-recorded videos that will be available for certain lectures? How will these videos be made available, and will they be required viewing for the course?
2. Under the "Online participation" section, it is mentioned that unforeseen circumstances may lead to changes in the course policies. How will the course structure and policies be communicated to students in the event of any changes?
3. What constitutes "a reasonable level of decorum" within online spaces? Are there any specific guidelines or expectations for student behavior and communication during class discussions, office hours, and other online interactions?
4. How will reinforcement exercises contribute to the overall grade, and what is the weightage assigned to each reinforcement exercise? Are there any specific requirements or guidelines for completing these exercises?
5. Can you provide more information on the plagiarism detection system that will be used for assignments and reinforcement exercises? How does the system work, and what are the consequences of plagiarism?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
