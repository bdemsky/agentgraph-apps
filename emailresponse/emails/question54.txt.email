Subject: Question about the syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for our course, and I find it to be very detailed and informative. However, I still have a question that I couldn't find the answer to in the syllabus.

Considering the in-person format of the course and the requirement for a stable internet connection, I was wondering if there will be any alternative arrangements for students who may not have access to a reliable internet connection or may be unable to physically attend some of the in-person sessions due to unforeseen circumstances. I understand that attendance is recommended but not graded for the regular lecture sessions, but I was curious if there is a plan in place to accommodate such situations.

Thank you for your time and clarification. I appreciate your efforts in providing us with a comprehensive syllabus, and I'm looking forward to starting the course.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
