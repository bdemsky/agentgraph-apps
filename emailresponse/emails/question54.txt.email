  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently reviewed. My question is regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be made available as part of the course.

Could you please clarify whether these videos will be available only to officially enrolled students or if they will also be available to auditors or non-enrolled individuals? I understand that attendance is not guaranteed for auditors or non-enrolled individuals, but I want to ensure that I have access to the videos in case I need to review them for any reason.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
