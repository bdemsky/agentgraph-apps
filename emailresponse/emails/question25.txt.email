Subject: Clarification on Course Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for ICS 45C and overall, it provides clear guidelines for the course. However, I would like to seek clarification on one specific point mentioned in the syllabus.

Regarding the reinforcement exercises, it is mentioned that they correspond to each week's lecture material and serve as a way for us to gauge our understanding of the topic. I understand that these exercises contribute to our overall grade. However, I would like to know if there is a specific deadline for completing and submitting the reinforcement exercises. Are they due at the end of each week or are they expected to be completed within a certain timeframe?

Thank you in advance for your time and clarification. I appreciate your assistance.

Best regards,
