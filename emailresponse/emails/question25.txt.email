  Subject: Seeking Clarification on ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on the ICS 45C course syllabus for the upcoming quarter. As I carefully reviewed the syllabus, I have a few questions that arose regarding the course structure and expectations.

Firstly, I would like to know more about the pre-recorded video content that will be available for certain lectures. Will these videos be available on the course website, and how will they be linked to the in-person lectures?

Additionally, I am curious about the schedule for the lab meetings. How often will these meetings take place, and what times are they available? Are there any specific sections or groups that I need to attend, or can I attend any lab meeting at my convenience?

Furthermore, I would like to clarify the grading criteria for the course. How are the weights of the graded artifacts determined, and what are the specific percentages associated with each component? Are there any additional resources or materials that I can use to improve my understanding of the course requirements and expectations?

Lastly, I would appreciate any guidance on academic honesty policies in the course. As a student, I understand the importance of maintaining academic integrity, and I want to ensure that I am aware of any specific policies or guidelines that I need to follow.

Thank you for your time and attention to my questions. I look forward to your response and a productive quarter in ICS 45C.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
