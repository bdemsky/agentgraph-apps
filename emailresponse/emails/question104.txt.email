  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that was provided to us at the beginning of the quarter. Specifically, I am curious about the statement under "Online decorum" that reads, "While it is not our intent to measure your participation — in the sense that we won't be tracking whether you're attending the lectures, watching pre-recorded videos, attending the lab sessions, and so on — we are requiring that students meet the decorum requirements described above."

Could you please clarify what you mean by "participation" in this context? Are you implying that we will be tracking our attendance and engagement in the course, even though you mentioned earlier that you will not be measuring our participation? If so, how will this tracking be done, and what are the consequences if we fail to meet the decorum requirements?

Thank you in advance for your clarification.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
