  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that I could not find an answer to by reading the document closely. I am wondering if you could provide some clarification on the following point:

What is the criteria for considered a "routine" exam week, and how will we know if an exam week is considered routine or not?

I understand that you mentioned in the syllabus that exams will take 12 hours of student time in a typical week, but I am unsure of what factors determine whether an exam week is considered routine or not. Will there be any announcements or notifications provided before each exam week to indicate whether it is a routine or non-routine exam week?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
