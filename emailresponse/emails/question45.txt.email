Subject: Clarification on Course Format and Online Requirements

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for our course, but I still have a question regarding the course format and online requirements. I want to ensure that I have a clear understanding of the expectations for the upcoming quarter.

In the syllabus, it states that the course will be administered in a predominantly in-person format. However, it also mentions that there will be online components, such as pre-recorded videos, Zoom meetings, and an Ed Discussion board. Could you please provide more information regarding the extent of these online components? Specifically, I would like to know how often we can anticipate utilizing the online resources and if they will be supplemental or integral to the in-person lectures.

Additionally, I would like to confirm if attending the in-person lectures is highly recommended but not mandatory, except on exam days. I want to ensure that I make the most effective use of my time and resources throughout the course.

Thank you for taking the time to clarify these details. I appreciate your assistance in helping me fully understand the expectations for the course.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
