  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I have carefully read through the ICS 46 syllabus and have a question regarding the online participation and decorum section. Specifically, I am unsure about what constitutes off-topic discussion in Ed Discussion. Could you please clarify what types of questions or topics are allowed in the forum, and what constitutes off-topic discussion?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
