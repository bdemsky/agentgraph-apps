  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question regarding the CompSci 161 syllabus that I could not find an answer to by reading the syllabus closely. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in clarifying the following:

What is the criteria for determining whether an exam question is considered "in-person instruction remains for the quarter"? Is it based on the number of students enrolled in the course, the date of the exam, or something else entirely?

Thank you in advance for your time and guidance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
