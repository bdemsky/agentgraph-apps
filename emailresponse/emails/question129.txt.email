  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that I have read carefully. My question is related to the grading policies and the expectations for the course.

Specifically, I am curious about the weightage of the warm-up exercises in the course. According to the syllabus, the warm-up exercises will be weighted equally, but it is not clear how this weightage will be determined. Will the exercises be graded on a pass/fail basis, or will there be a numerical grade assigned? Additionally, will the warm-up exercises be evaluated for content coverage and accuracy, or will they solely be based on completion?

I understand that this may seem like a trivial question, but I want to make sure I understand the expectations for the course. I appreciate your time and guidance in this matter.

Thank you,

[Your Name]
