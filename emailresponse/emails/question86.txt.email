  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Organization and Grading Policies

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few aspects of the ICS 45C course syllabus that I find unclear or have questions about. As a student in the course, I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide.

Firstly, I am unclear about the pre-recorded video content that will be available for certain lectures. Will these videos be available for viewing at any time, or are they only accessible at specific times? Additionally, how will these videos supplement the in-person lectures, and will they cover the same material?

Secondly, I am interested in knowing more about the grading policies for the course. Specifically, how will the weights of the different graded artifacts be determined, and what are the consequences of not meeting the decorum requirements? How will deductions be determined, and what is the maximum deduction that can be made for any single instance of non-compliance?

Lastly, I would like to inquire about the policy regarding collaboration on projects and reinforcement exercises. Are group projects allowed, or is individual work expected? Are there any specific guidelines for citing sources and avoiding plagiarism in these assignments?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to your response and any additional guidance you can provide.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
