  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Requirements and Expectations

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on some of the requirements and expectations outlined in the syllabus for ICS 45C, which I have been appointed to take this quarter. As I carefully reviewed the syllabus, I have some questions that I would greatly appreciate your insight on.

Firstly, I am unsure about the format of the in-person lectures. Will they be held in a traditional classroom setting, or will there be any online components to the lectures? Additionally, are there any specific requirements for the equipment I will need to bring to the lectures, such as a laptop or tablet?

Secondly, I am curious about the pre-recorded videos that will be available through Canvas. Will these videos cover the entire course material, or will they be focused on specific topics? How will these videos be graded, and will they contribute to my overall course grade?

Thirdly, I would like to clarify the expectations for online participation and decorum. What constitutes appropriate behavior and decorum in an online setting, and are there any consequences for not adhering to these expectations?

Lastly, I am interested in understanding the grading rubric for the course. How will my course grade be determined, and what percentage of my grade will be allocated to each assignment and exam? Are there any additional factors that will be taken into consideration when determining my final grade?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions, and I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
