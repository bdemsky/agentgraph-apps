  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely. I am inquiring about the grading policies for the course, specifically the weighting of assignments and exams.

According to the syllabus, the mid-quarter topic exams are worth 10% of the overall grade, and the demonstrated competency of core topics is worth 20% of the overall grade. However, the syllabus does not provide any information on the weighting of the warm-up exercises that are due prior to each exam.

Could you please clarify the weighting of the warm-up exercises in the course, and how they fit into the overall grading structure? I understand that the syllabus may not provide all the details, but I would appreciate any clarification you can provide.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
