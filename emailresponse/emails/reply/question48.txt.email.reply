  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John Smith,

Thank you for your email and for reaching out to me with your questions about the EECS 114 course. I'm happy to help you.

To answer your first question, the syllabus does provide guidance on what constitutes "useful" comments in the assignments. According to section 4.1, programs must be well documented with comments that are "useful" and "appropriate." This means that comments should explain the purpose and logic of the code, and should be written in a clear and concise manner.

In terms of specific requirements or guidelines, the syllabus does not provide any additional information beyond the general expectation that comments should be "useful." However, you may find it helpful to consult tutorials or resources on software development best practices for further guidance on how to write good comments.

Regarding your second question, I apologize, but the syllabus does not provide any exceptions to the late policy for assignments. As stated in section 5, all assignments must be submitted on time to receive full credit. If you have a conflicting commitment on one of the assignment due dates, I would encourage you to prioritize your academic work and make every effort to submit your assignment on time.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
