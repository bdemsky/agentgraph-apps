  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in EECS 114. I'm happy to help you.

To submit your assignments electronically while logged into the server, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a valid account on the server. If you don't have one, please contact the course TA or me for assistance.
2. Save your assignment file with a proper naming convention and format (e.g., lastname_firstname_assignmentname.txt).
3. Log in to the server using SSH and navigate to the directory where you want to submit your assignment.
4. Use the command "sudo append_file /course/path/to/assignment.txt" to submit your assignment.

For the format and structure of the assignments, you can refer to the course syllabus, section 4.1 Commenting Code. It is essential to include useful and well-documented comments in your code to receive full credit.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
