Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency. I'm happy to help you.

1. The assignments will be available in the Google Drive folder by the specified deadlines, so you can plan your time accordingly. However, please note that the assignments may also be available at a later time if you encounter any technical issues or other unforeseen circumstances.
2. For the assignments, you will need to use the programming languages and tools specified in the course syllabus. Please refer to the course slides or the syllabus for the specific details on the required tools and software.
3. The academic honesty policy in COMPSCI 295 is strictly enforced, and any violations will result in severe penalties. According to the syllabus, "Cheating is a dishonest representation of the course work, including but not limited to cheating on exams, fraudulently presenting lab exercises or assignments by someone else as one's own, or getting someone else to take the course. It is a serious academic offense that will not be tolerated. Cheaters can expect to receive a failing grade and will be punished according to University regulations."

If you have any further questions or concerns, please refer to the course syllabus or feel free to ask. I'm here to help.
