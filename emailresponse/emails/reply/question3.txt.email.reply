  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the EECS 40 course. I'm happy to help answer your questions.

Regarding your first question, the syllabus does provide the exact percentage breakdown for each assignment. According to the syllabus, assignments are worth 50% of the total grade, with each assignment worth a percentage of the total grade based on the assignment's difficulty and complexity. The syllabus does not provide more detailed information on the percentage breakdown for each assignment, so I'm afraid I cannot provide that information to you at this time.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does mention that late assignments will receive reduced credit. According to the syllabus, late assignments will receive a penalty of 10% per day, up to a maximum penalty of 50%. So, if an assignment is turned in one day late, the student will receive a penalty of 10%, and if it is turned in two days late, the student will receive a penalty of 20%, and so on.

Regarding your third question, the syllabus does provide some guidance on writing comments for code. According to the syllabus, well-documented code with useful comments will receive full credit. The syllabus defines "useful comments" as comments that explain the purpose and reasoning behind the code, provide context for the code, and make the code easier to understand and maintain. The syllabus also notes that excessive, insufficient, or useless comments will result in deducted points.

I hope this information is helpful, John. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
