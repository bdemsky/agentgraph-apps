  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help you.

Firstly, you can absolutely work with a partner on the assignments in the course. As the syllabus states, both partners should contribute equally to each assignment, and it is important to collaborate and learn from each other. However, please make sure to keep track of your partner's contributions and ensure that both of you are contributing equally.

Regarding the grading criteria, the syllabus does provide some information on the expectations for each assignment. For example, it mentions that late penalties will be applied for projects submitted beyond the deadline. Additionally, the syllabus states that assignments should be turned in on time, and if you cannot make a deadline, you should arrange an alternative deadline with the instructors.

However, I cannot answer your question about the specific grading criteria for each assignment as that information is not provided in the syllabus. I suggest you review the course material and the assignments carefully to understand the expectations for each assignment.

Finally, please note that the syllabus is subject to changes as necessary, so it is important to check the course website regularly for any updates.

I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
