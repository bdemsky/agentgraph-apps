  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the EECS 40 course syllabus. I'm happy to help you.

To answer your first question, the syllabus does provide some guidelines for the level of documentation expected in the assignments. According to section 4.1, programs should have useful comments that are helpful for understanding the code. While there is no specific requirement for the level of documentation, it is expected that each function or method should have a detailed description. This will help you earn full credit for your assignments.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does mention that late assignments will receive reduced credit. However, there are no penalties for submitting an assignment that is significantly late. If you are unable to submit an assignment on time, please reach out to me in advance to make alternative arrangements.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
