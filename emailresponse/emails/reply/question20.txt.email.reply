  Subject: Re: Homework Questions

Dear John,

Thank you for your email. I appreciate your interest in clarifying the homework assignments for the EECS 221 course.

Regarding your first question, the syllabus does provide some details on the homework assignments. According to the syllabus, there will be a total of 6 homework assignments throughout the semester, and each assignment will count for 10% of the final grade. The syllabus also mentions that the assignments will be a combination of programming assignments and written assignments.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not specify which programming languages you should use for the assignments. However, the course does cover a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, and MATLAB. You are free to choose any of these languages for your assignments, as long as you follow the guidelines provided in the syllabus.

Regarding your third question, the syllabus does not provide specific guidance on what topics or areas of focus you should cover in your assignments. The course is designed to cover research papers in the field of program analysis, and the assignments are meant to help you apply the concepts and techniques discussed in class to real-world problems. You are encouraged to be creative and think critically about how to apply the course material to your assignments.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
