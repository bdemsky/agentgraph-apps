  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I'm happy to help you with your questions.

With regards to your first question, the breakdown of assignments and their weightage in the final grade can be found in section 4.1 of the syllabus. It states that assignments are worth 50% of the final grade, and that they will be graded based on the quality of their implementation, the clarity of their documentation, and their adherence to the course's programming standards.

Regarding your second question, late assignments will be penalized according to the course's grading policy, which can be found in section 7 of the syllabus. It states that late assignments will receive reduced credit, and the amount of reduction will depend on the reason for the delay and the instructor's discretion.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Brian Demsky
