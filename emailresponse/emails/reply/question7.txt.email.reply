  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for reaching out to me regarding the assignments in EECS 114. I apologize, but I can see from the syllabus that the course policies and assignment details are clearly outlined.

According to the syllabus, assignments must be turned in on time and late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. Additionally, the course website provides detailed instructions on how to submit homework electronically while logging into the server.

I would recommend checking the course website and the syllabus carefully for the answers to your questions about the assignments. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
