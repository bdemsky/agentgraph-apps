  Subject: Re: Question on Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your question about the assignments in EECS 114. I apologize for any confusion, and I'm happy to help you.

From Section 4.2 of the syllabus, it seems that all assignments must be turned in on time, and late submissions will not be graded. The syllabus does not provide specific guidelines on the format and content of the assignments, but it does mention that programs must be well documented with useful comments.

To clarify, the assignments in EECS 114 are designed to test your understanding of the course material, and they should be completed individually. Any form of academic dishonesty, including cheating on exams or sharing code with other students, is not tolerated and will result in severe consequences.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help you succeed in the course.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
