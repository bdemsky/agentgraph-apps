  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question about the assignments in EECS 114. I'm happy to help you.

According to section 4.1 of the course syllabus, "Programs must be well documented with useful comments. Excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points." The syllabus does not provide specific guidelines for the format or structure of the comments, but it does state that the comments should be useful and relevant to the program.

I recommend reviewing the syllabus and the course material to better understand what constitutes useful comments. You can also refer to the course website for additional resources and guidance.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
