  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course policies. I appreciate your attention to detail and your commitment to understanding the course requirements.

To answer your first question, the syllabus does provide some guidance on exceptions to the late assignment policy. According to section 4.1 of the syllabus, "Programs must be turned in on time. Late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit." However, the syllabus also states that "the instructor reserves the right to accept late assignments in cases of extreme circumstances or medical emergencies."

Therefore, if you are experiencing any difficulties that may prevent you from submitting an assignment on time, please reach out to me and provide documentation of your situation. I will review your request and make a determination on a case-by-case basis.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does provide some guidance on what constitutes "excessive, insufficient, or useless comments" in the programs. According to section 4.2 of the syllabus, "Programs must be well documented with useful comments. Excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points."

In general, useful comments should provide clear explanations of the code, highlight any key algorithms or techniques used, and include any relevant documentation or references. Excessive comments, on the other hand, can clutter the code and make it more difficult to understand. Insufficient comments may leave the reader with too many questions about how the code works or why certain decisions were made. Useless comments, such as redundant or irrelevant text, can also result in deducted points.

I hope this information is helpful, John. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
