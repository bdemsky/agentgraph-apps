  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the EECS 40 course. I'm happy to help you.

Regarding your first question, the syllabus does provide guidance on what constitutes "useful comments" in the assignments. According to section 4.1, programs must be well documented with "useful comments." This means that you should include comments for each section of your code, explaining what the code is doing and why. This will help both you and your instructor understand the code better.

As for your second question, late assignments will indeed receive reduced credit. According to section 5, all assignments must be turned in on time. If you are unable to meet a deadline, you should contact your instructor in advance to make alternative arrangements.

Regarding your question, I can not answer your question at this time as it is not covered in the syllabus provided.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
