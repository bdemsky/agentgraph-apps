  Subject: Re: Question about Midterm Exam in Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question. I'm happy to help.

After reviewing the syllabus for Computer Science 142A, I noticed that the midterm exam details are outlined in the course syllabus under the "Lectures, Discussions, and Labs" section. Specifically, it is listed that the midterm exam will be held on [Date and Time] and will cover the topics outlined in the course slides and lectures up to that point.

However, I cannot answer your question about optional review sessions or recommended textbooks/resources for preparation as that information is not provided in the syllabus.

Please refer to the syllabus for the most up-to-date information on course policies and procedures. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me or your TAs.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
