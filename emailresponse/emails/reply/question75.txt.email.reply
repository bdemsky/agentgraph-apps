  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 221 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your question about the assignments in EECS 221.

According to section 9 of the syllabus, it is the responsibility of each student to ensure that their assignments are original and not copied from any other person or source. While the syllabus does not explicitly mention the use of automated tools for checking plagiarism, it does emphasize the importance of academic honesty and the consequences of cheating.

As such, I suggest you focus on understanding the course material and completing your assignments with original work. The syllabus provides guidelines for the structure and content of the assignments, and you can refer to it for any questions or clarifications you may have.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
