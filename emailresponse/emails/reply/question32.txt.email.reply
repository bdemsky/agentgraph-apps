  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question. I'm happy to help you understand the requirements for the assignments in EECS 40.

According to section 4.1 of the syllabus, "Programs must be well documented with useful comments. Excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points."

In terms of the level of detail for the comments, it is recommended to provide a brief explanation of what the code is doing, but not necessarily cover all aspects of the code. The comments should be clear and concise, and help the instructor and peers understand the purpose and logic of the code.

Regarding the format of the comments, there are no specific requirements mentioned in the syllabus. However, it is generally recommended to use a consistent and standardized format for comments to make them easier to read and understand.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
