  Subject: Re: Question about Concurrency in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the COMPSCI 295 course. I'm happy to help you understand more about the course material and assignments.

The syllabus provides a detailed overview of the course topics, including formalisms for reasoning about concurrent data structures and the development of lock-free and wait-free data structures. The course will cover various topics such as scalable data structures, memory models, and tools for correctness models.

Regarding resources outside of the course material, I would recommend checking out the course slides and the required book, "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Maurice Herlihy and Nir Shavit. These resources will provide a comprehensive overview of the concepts of concurrency and how they are applied in practice.

However, I cannot answer your question at this time as it is not covered in the syllabus. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
