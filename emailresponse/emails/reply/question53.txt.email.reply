  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I'm happy to help you with your questions.

To answer your first question, the syllabus does provide guidelines for writing comments in the programs you submit for the assignments. According to section 4.1 of the syllabus, "Programs must be well documented with useful comments. Excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points." So, please make sure to include clear and concise comments in your programs to avoid any deductions.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not provide any specific guidelines for using other platforms to develop and test your programs. However, as you mentioned, Sun Solaris is the standard platform used for the course, and all course work will be checked and graded on the server. So, it is important to use the platform specified in the syllabus to ensure that your work is properly graded.

Lastly, the syllabus does provide instructions for submitting assignments electronically while logged into the server. According to section 4.2, "All assignments must be turned in on time. Late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. Detailed instructions on how to submit homework will be listed with each assignment." So, please make sure to follow the instructions provided for each assignment and submit your work on time.

I hope this information helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
