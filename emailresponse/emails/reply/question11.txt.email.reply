  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the assignments in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help.

Regarding your question about the late penalty policy for projects, the syllabus does provide clear guidance on this matter. According to the syllabus, late penalties for projects are calculated based on the number of days late, with a deduction of 5% for the first three days, 8% from three to seven days, and 10% until the end of the quarter.

However, I cannot answer your question about how to handle situations where one partner does most of the work as it is not addressed in the syllabus. It is important to note that both partners are expected to contribute equally to each assignment, and if one partner does most of the work, it may result in a deduction of credit or a failing grade for the assignment.

I would suggest consulting with your partner and working together to ensure that both of you are contributing equally to each assignment. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
