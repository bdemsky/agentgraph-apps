  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I appreciate your proactive approach to clarifying any doubts you may have.

To answer your first question, all assignments in COMPSCI 295 will be individual assignments. You will be working alone on each assignment, and you will be responsible for your own work. However, you are encouraged to discuss the course material with your classmates and seek help from them if needed.

Regarding the submission process, you can find the details on how to submit your assignments in the course syllabus. You will need to upload your assignments to the designated Google Drive folder by the specified deadline.

As for sample assignments or practice problems, I apologize, but we will not be providing any before the assignments are due. However, you can find some sample problems and exercises in the course textbook, "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Maurice Herlihy and Nir Shavit. These may help you better understand the requirements and expectations for each assignment.

Finally, I would like to remind you that academic honesty is a fundamental principle of this course, and any form of cheating will not be tolerated. Please make sure to follow the academic integrity policies outlined in the course syllabus.

I hope this information helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
