  Subject: Re: Question about Lectures in COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the course and your desire to prepare for the lectures.

I apologize, but the detailed schedule of lectures, including the specific dates and topics, is not available at this time. The syllabus provides the general information about the course, but the specific details of the lectures are subject to change as we discover what works and what doesn't work remotely.

However, I encourage you to review the course slides, which are available in the Google drive folder provided in the syllabus. The slides cover the topics that will be covered in the lectures, and they provide a good framework for understanding the material.

Regarding accessing other resources, I can inform you that I will be using a variety of materials throughout the course, including articles, videos, and other resources. I will provide you with the necessary information and links as we proceed through the course.

In terms of preparing for the lectures, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the course material and reviewing the slides before each lecture. This will help you to better understand the concepts and engage more fully in the discussions.

I hope this information is helpful, and I look forward to seeing you in the lectures. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
