  Subject: Re: Question about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question. I appreciate your enthusiasm and interest in the course.

After reviewing the syllabus, I can confirm that the homework assignments will be graded based on the correctness of the code submitted. The assignments will focus on implementing various concurrent data structures and evaluating their performance, so it is important that your code is correct and efficient.

Regarding additional resources or guidance, I do provide some examples and tutorials in the course slides and lectures. Additionally, you can use online resources such as the textbook and other academic papers to deepen your understanding of the topics.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
