  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's an example email that the instructor could send in response to the student's question:

Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the EECS 114 syllabus. I appreciate your diligence in reviewing the course materials and seeking clarification.

To answer your first question, assignments must be turned in on time according to the schedule provided in the syllabus. While we may accept assignments up to a certain time after the deadline, late assignments may not be graded if they are submitted significantly after the deadline. Please refer to section 4.1 of the syllabus for more information.

Regarding your second question, "course work" in section 4.2 refers to any graded work that is required as part of the course, including assignments, quizzes, and exams. All course work will be checked and graded on the server, as stated in the syllabus.

I hope this helps clarify any questions you may have about the course. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
