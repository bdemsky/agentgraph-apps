  Subject: Re: Question about Homework in EECS 221

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I'm happy to help answer your questions.

According to section 8 of the syllabus, the homework assignments will be individual work and will count for 60% of the total grade. There will be a total of 4-5 homework assignments throughout the semester, and they will cover various topics related to program analysis.

As for specific details on the assignments, I apologize, but that information is not available at this time. The assignments will be designed to help you practice and apply the concepts we cover in class, and the specific topics and areas of focus will be announced in class and on the course website.

Regarding flexibility in case of unforeseen circumstances, please know that I understand that unexpected things can happen, and I will do my best to accommodate any valid reasons for missing a deadline. However, please communicate with me as soon as possible if you encounter any difficulties, and we can discuss possible solutions.

I hope this information helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
