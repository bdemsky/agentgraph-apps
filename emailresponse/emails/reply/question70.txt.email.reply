  Subject: Re: Question about Lectures in the Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the lectures in our Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters course. I'm happy to help you.

To answer your first question, the lectures will indeed be recorded and posted online. The recordings will be available on the course's Yuja page, which you can access through the UCI Course Portal. Please refer to the syllabus for the specific link to the course page.

Regarding your second question, we do not have any live streaming or virtual attendance options for lectures at this time. However, I encourage you to attend the lectures in person if possible, as there will be opportunities for in-class discussions and interactions that may not be possible through virtual attendance.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to help.

Best regards,
Brian Demsky
