  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency. I'm happy to help you.

1. Discussing Assignments with Classmates:

Yes, you are absolutely free to discuss the assignments with your classmates. In fact, collaboration is encouraged as it can help you better understand the concepts and develop your skills. However, please make sure that any code or ideas you share with your classmates are your own work and do not violate any academic integrity policies.

2. Grading Criteria:

I apologize, but the grading criteria for the assignments are not explicitly stated in the syllabus. However, I can tell you that the assignments will be graded based on their correctness, simplicity, and clarity. You can find more details on the grading criteria in the course slides, which are available on Google Drive.

3. Course Slides:

I apologize, but you are not able to access the course slides at this time. The course slides are only available to students who are logged into their UCI account. Please try logging in to access them.

I hope this information helps, John. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
