  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the assignments in EECS 221. I apologize, but I can not answer your question at this time as the information you are seeking is not available in the syllabus.

However, I would like to direct you to the course mailing list, where you can ask your classmates for help or resources that may be available for completing the assignments. The mailing list is eecs228-S19@classes.uci.edu, and you are free to send an email to your classmates for assistance.

Additionally, I encourage you to review the course syllabus carefully, as it contains most of the information you are seeking. The syllabus outlines the course format, grading policy, and the types of assignments that will be included in the course.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns, and I will do my best to assist you.

Best regards,
Brian Demsky
