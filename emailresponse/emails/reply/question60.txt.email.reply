  Subject: Re: Question about Lectures in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question. I'm happy to help you.

To answer your question, the lectures will indeed be recorded and posted online for those who cannot attend the live sessions. According to the syllabus, the lectures will be recorded and posted on the course's Yuja page. You can access the recorded lectures by cloning the git repository at the provided link.

Please refer to the syllabus for more information on how to access the recorded lectures. If you have any issues or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me or your TAs.

Thank you for your inquiry, and I hope this information helps.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
