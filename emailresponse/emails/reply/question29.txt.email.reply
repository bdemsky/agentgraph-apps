  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's an email response to the student:

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the EECS 40 course. I apologize, but the syllabus does not provide specific details on what constitutes "excessive, insufficient, or useless comments" in the programs you submit for grading.

However, I would like to clarify that the course instructors expect programs to be well-documented with useful comments that help clarify the code's purpose and functionality. Comments that are unnecessary, redundant, or do not add value to the program may result in deductions in points.

To avoid any confusion, I recommend reviewing the course materials and paying close attention to the commenting guidelines provided throughout the syllabus. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me or the teaching assistant.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
