  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help you.

1. Yes, you can submit your assignments as a git repository. In fact, it is recommended as it allows you to track your progress and easily collaborate with your partner. Please make sure to submit your assignments to the correct repository on the course's Yuja page.
2. The deadlines for each assignment can be found on the course's edstem page and in the syllabus. Please refer to these resources for the specific deadlines for each assignment.
3. Yes, you will be graded on both the quality of your code and the speed at which you complete the assignments. While it is important to complete the assignments on time, it is equally important to ensure that your code is well-written, meets the requirements, and demonstrates your understanding of the course material.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to help.

Best regards,
Brian Demsky
