  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency. I'm happy to help you.

Firstly, I can inform you that the assignments in the course will be individual assignments, and they will be submitted through the course website. You can find the submission details in the course syllabus, which is available on the course website.

Regarding the course slides, you can access them by logging into your UCI account and visiting the course Google Drive folder link provided in the syllabus.

For the tools or software that you will be using for the assignments, I can inform you that we will be using a variety of programming languages and tools, including lock-free and wait-free data structures. However, I cannot provide you with specific information on the tools or software we will be using, as this is a course that explores the development of concurrent data structures, and the tools and software used may vary depending on the specific topics being covered in each assignment.

I hope this information helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
