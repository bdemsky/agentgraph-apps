  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I appreciate your attention to detail regarding the assignments in the syllabus.

To answer your first question, the syllabus (section 4.1) does provide guidelines for commenting code. It states that programs must be well documented with useful comments. This means that you should include comments for every line of code that is not self-explanatory, including variable declarations, function calls, and any other significant elements of the program. The comments should provide a brief description of what each line of code is doing, and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not provide specific instructions on how to install Android on a MAC. However, you can find the necessary instructions on the Android developer website, which is linked in the syllabus (section 4.2). It is possible to install Android on a MAC using a virtual machine or by following the instructions provided on the Android developer website.

In regards to your question, I can not answer your question at this time. The syllabus does not provide information on how to install Android on a MAC, and I do not have access to additional information beyond what is provided in the syllabus.

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
