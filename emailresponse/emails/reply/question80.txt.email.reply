  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email. I'm happy to help answer your questions about the assignments in EECS 221: Program Analysis.

1. The assignments in the course will consist of a combination of programming and written assignments. The specific types of assignments will be announced in class and will be based on the topics covered in the course.
2. For the programming assignments, you will be expected to write code that analyzes and visualizes program behavior, and to recover from software failures. The written assignments will focus on the theoretical foundations of program analysis and will require you to apply the concepts learned in class to real-world scenarios.
3. There are no specific topics or areas of focus that you must concentrate on when completing the assignments. However, you are expected to follow the instructions provided in the syllabus and to complete each assignment to the best of your ability.
4. The course mailing list, eecs228-S19@classes.uci.edu, is a great resource for getting help with assignments. You can also use the course resources, such as the textbook and any additional materials provided by the instructor, to help you complete the assignments.

Regarding your question about resources for completing the assignments, I can tell you that the course syllabus provides a list of recommended books and resources that may be helpful for your assignments. Additionally, the course instructors and teaching assistants will be available to answer questions and provide guidance during office hours and through the course mailing list.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
