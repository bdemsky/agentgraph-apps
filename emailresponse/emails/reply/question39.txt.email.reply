  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your questions about the assignments in EECS 40.

To answer your first question, the weightage of the assignments in the course is indeed 50%. However, the syllabus does not provide the specific points for each assignment as it is expected that you will complete each assignment to the best of your abilities and submit it on time.

Regarding your second question, you are allowed to work in groups for the assignments, but you must specify who will submit the assignment on behalf of the group. Additionally, you are expected to write your own code and not copy from others.

As for your third question, the format and organization of the code are not specified in the syllabus. However, you can find general guidelines for writing clean and well-organized code in the course website.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

Note: If you cannot answer the student's question at this time, please say so politely and inform them that you will get back to them as soon as possible.
