  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the assignments in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help you.

Firstly, I recommend reviewing the syllabus for the course, as many of your questions can be found there. For example, the expectations for each assignment and the grading criteria are outlined in the syllabus under the "Labs and Assignments" section.

Regarding your question about the collaborative assignments, the syllabus does provide some guidance. The assignments are expected to cover the material discussed in lectures and slides, and both partners are expected to contribute equally to the assignment. If there is a significant disparity in work between the partners, the grade may be adjusted accordingly.

As for submitting the assignments, they should be submitted as a git repository. The syllabus provides detailed instructions on how to submit the assignments.

In terms of approaching the assignments, I would recommend starting by reviewing the course materials and understanding the concepts covered in the lectures and slides. Then, you can begin working on the assignments, breaking them down into smaller tasks and making sure to follow the guidelines provided in the syllabus.

If you have any further questions or need clarification on any of the assignments, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
