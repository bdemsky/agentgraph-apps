  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the EECS 221 course. I appreciate your eagerness to understand the course requirements and policies.

To answer your first question, the syllabus provides detailed information on the assignments, including the types of assignments, deadlines, and grading criteria. Please refer to section 7 of the syllabus for more information on the assignments.

Regarding your second question, the grading policy is outlined in section 8 of the syllabus. The breakdown of the grade is as follows: 30% for the final examination, 60% for homeworks and projects, and 10% for participation. The participation grade will be calculated based on class attendance and participation in discussions, as well as completion of assigned readings and other activities.

I apologize, but I cannot answer your third question at this time as it is not covered in the syllabus. The syllabus clearly states that academic honesty is a serious offense and that students are expected to complete their own work. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I wish you the best of luck in the course.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
