  Subject: Re: Question about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the homework assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency. I appreciate your eagerness to understand the format and requirements for the assignments.

As you mentioned, the syllabus does provide some information on the homework assignments, including the due dates and the use of an automated tool for grading. However, I can inform you that the syllabus does not provide detailed instructions or guidelines for formatting and submitting the assignments.

Regarding your question about the automated tool, I can tell you that it is a sophisticated algorithm that can detect copied code even when all methods, fields, classes, and variables have been renamed, and all comments have changed. However, I cannot provide more detailed information on the tool as it is a proprietary software and I do not have access to the specific details.

With regards to your question about plagiarism, I can inform you that it is a serious academic offense that will not be tolerated in this course. As mentioned in the syllabus, each assignment must contain a statement certifying that the work is the student's own and that no code was copied from any other person or source. If you have any questions or concerns about plagiarism, I encourage you to speak with me or the course TAs.

In conclusion, I can not answer your question at this time regarding the specific instructions or guidelines for formatting and submitting the assignments. However, I encourage you to review the syllabus and the course materials closely for any relevant information. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
