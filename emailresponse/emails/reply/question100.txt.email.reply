  Subject: Re: Questions about Homework in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the homework assignments in COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency.

To answer your first question, the course syllabus does provide some guidance on the tools and software required for the homework assignments. According to the syllabus, you will need to use a model checker to verify the correctness of your concurrent data structures. However, it is not specified which specific model checker you should use. You may need to consult with your instructor or conduct further research to determine which model checker is most appropriate for the course.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does provide guidelines for formatting and submitting the homework assignments. You will need to submit your code in a specified format, such as a ZIP file, and include a README file that describes your implementation. You can find more details on the formatting requirements in the course syllabus.

Finally, the syllabus does not provide any examples or templates for the homework assignments. However, you may find it helpful to consult with your instructor or review examples from previous years' courses to get a better understanding of how to structure and organize your code.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
