  Subject: Re: Question about Homework in EECS 221

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question about the homework assignments in EECS 221. I apologize, but the information you are seeking is not available in the syllabus.

According to section 9 of the syllabus, the homework assignments will account for 60% of the final grade, and they will involve a combination of coding and theoretical questions. However, the specific assignments and their grading criteria are not provided in the syllabus.

I recommend reviewing the course materials and attending the lectures to gain a better understanding of the assignments and their expectations. Additionally, you can reach out to your instructor or teaching assistant for more information.

I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
