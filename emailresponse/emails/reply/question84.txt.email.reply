  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I'm happy to help answer your questions.

To answer your first question, the programming assignments can be submitted in any programming language that is commonly used in the field of computer science, such as Java, Python, C++, etc. However, please refer to the course syllabus for specific guidelines on the format and structure of the assignments.

Regarding your second question, the written assignments are designed to cover a range of topics related to program analysis. While there are no specific areas of focus that I would like you to explore in greater depth, I encourage you to delve into the topics that interest you the most and that are relevant to the course material.

Finally, the final examination will be a take-home exam that will consist of multiple-choice questions and short-answer questions. The exam will be two hours long and will cover all the material covered in the course.

I hope this information helps, John. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
