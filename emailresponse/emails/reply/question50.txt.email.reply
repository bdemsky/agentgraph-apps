  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question about the assignments in EECS 114. I'm happy to help.

According to the course syllabus, the assignments in EECS 114 are individual assignments. The syllabus states that "Assignments must be turned in on time. Late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit." (Section 4.1)

Regarding the format and requirements for the code, the syllabus does not provide specific guidelines. However, it does mention that programs must be well documented with useful comments. Excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points. (Section 4.1)

I hope this information helps answer your question. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
