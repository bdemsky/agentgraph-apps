  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the EECS 40 course syllabus.

To answer your first question, the syllabus does not provide a specific requirement for the level of documentation required for assignments. However, it does state that programs must be well documented with useful comments. This means that you should include comments that explain the purpose of each line of code, method, and function in your program. This will help you earn full credit for your assignments and make it easier for the instructor to evaluate your work.

Regarding late assignments, the syllabus states that late assignments will receive reduced credit. The specific policy for late assignments is as follows:

* Assignments submitted within 24 hours of the original deadline will receive 50% credit.
* Assignments submitted between 24-48 hours after the original deadline will receive 25% credit.
* Assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the original deadline will not be accepted and will receive a grade of 0.

In terms of submitting assignments late, please note that you can submit your assignments at any time before the end of the course. However, I cannot guarantee that your assignment will be evaluated or that you will receive full credit if you submit it after the original deadline.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
