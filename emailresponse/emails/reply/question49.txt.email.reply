  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear John Smith,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question. I apologize, but the answer to your question can be found in the course syllabus. In section 4.1, it states that assignments must be turned in on time and late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. Additionally, the syllabus provides detailed instructions on how to submit assignments, including the required file format.

Please refer to the syllabus for the answers to your questions. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
