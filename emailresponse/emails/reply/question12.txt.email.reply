  Subject: Re: Questions about Lectures in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the course. I'm happy to help you.

To answer your first question, the topics that will be covered during the lectures on "Overview of Compilers" on April 4th and 6th will include an introduction to the course, the history of compilers, and the different types of compilers. You can find more information on these topics in Chapter 1 of the required textbook, "Engineering a Compiler, Second Edition" by Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon.

Regarding your second question, the readings assigned for the "Scanning" lecture on April 6th and 11th are from Chapter 2 of the required textbook. The topics covered in this chapter include the basic concepts of scanning, such as lexical analysis and tokenization. I recommend carefully reading through these sections in the textbook to prepare for the lectures.

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
