Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in EECS 221. I appreciate your eagerness to understand the requirements of the course and to prepare for the final examination.

I can confirm that the format and weightage of the assignments in the course are outlined in the syllabus. According to the syllabus, the assignments are worth 60% of your final grade, and they will include a combination of programming assignments and written assignments. The syllabus also provides detailed instructions on how to complete each type of assignment.

Regarding collaboration, the syllabus does not specify any restrictions on collaboration for the assignments. However, I would like to remind you that academic honesty is a critical aspect of the course, and any instances of cheating or plagiarism will result in serious consequences. Please ensure that you complete all assignments independently and in accordance with the course policies.

Finally, I can inform you that the course materials, including the lecture notes and practice problems, are available on the course website. The website also provides additional resources and tools to help you prepare for the final examination.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am here to support you throughout the course.

Best regards,
