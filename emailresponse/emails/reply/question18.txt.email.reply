  Subject: Re: Question about Homework in EECS 221

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the homework assignments in EECS 221. I apologize, but I can not answer your question at this time as the information you are seeking is not available in the course syllabus.

The syllabus does provide an overview of the course policies, including the weightage of homeworks in the overall grade, but it does not provide detailed information on the format of the assignments or the specific tools or software that will be used.

I would recommend reviewing the syllabus carefully and reaching out to me or other course instructors if you have any additional questions or concerns. We are here to help and support you throughout the course.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
