  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your question about the assignments in EECS 114. I appreciate your proactive approach to ensuring you receive full credit for your work.

To answer your question, the instructions for submitting assignments electronically while logged into the server can be found in section 4.2 of the course syllabus. According to the syllabus, all course work should be submitted electronically while logged into the server using SSH. Detailed instructions on how to submit your assignments will be provided with each assignment.

I apologize, but I cannot answer your question at this time as the information you are seeking is not available in the course syllabus. However, I encourage you to review the syllabus carefully and reach out to me or the teaching assistant if you have any further questions or concerns.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
