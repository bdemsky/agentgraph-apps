  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question regarding the assignments in EECS 40. I apologize for any confusion, and I appreciate your diligence in seeking clarification.

Upon reviewing the syllabus for EECS 40, I noticed that there are specific guidelines for commenting code in the assignments. According to the syllabus, "programs must be well documented with useful comments, and excessive, insufficient, or useless comments will result in deducted points."

Therefore, I recommend reviewing the syllabus carefully to ensure that your code is well-documented and meets the requirements outlined in the course materials. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.

I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best of luck in your course.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
