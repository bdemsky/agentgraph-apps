  Subject: Re: Question about Homework in EECS 221

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question about the homework assignments in EECS 221. I'm happy to help.

After reviewing the syllabus for the course, I noticed that the specific topics and complexity of the homework assignments are not explicitly stated. However, the syllabus does provide an overview of the course and the research topics that will be covered, which may help you prepare for the assignments.

Regarding the tools and resources that will be used for the homework assignments, the syllabus does mention that we will be using "tools, libraries, and frameworks" that are relevant to the course material. However, I cannot provide more specific information on these tools without further context.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
