  Subject: Re: Request for Clarification on Recording in the Syllabus

Dear [Student Name],

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the recording section in the syllabus for Computer Science 142A: Compilers and Interpreters.

I apologize, but the syllabus does not provide information on whether the lectures, discussions, and labs will be recorded and posted online. However, I can suggest checking the course's Yuja page for any available lectures that work through developing a simplified compiler. These lectures may provide a helpful resource for reviewing the material after class.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I will do my best to assist you.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
