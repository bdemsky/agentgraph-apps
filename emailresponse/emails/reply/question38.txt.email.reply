  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question about the assignments in EECS 40. I'm happy to help you.

According to the syllabus, the assignments are worth 50% of the total course grade. However, I apologize, but the syllabus does not provide a breakdown of the percentage weightage for each assignment.

To answer your second question, I would recommend approaching the assignments with a clear understanding of the course material and the requirements for each assignment. Make sure to read and follow the instructions carefully, and feel free to ask your teaching assistant or me if you have any questions or need clarification.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
