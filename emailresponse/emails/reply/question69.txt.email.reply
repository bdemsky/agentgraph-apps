  Subject: Re: Questions on Assignments in Computer Science 142A

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the assignments in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help you with your questions.

To answer your first question, yes, it is possible to turn in assignments as a git repository. In fact, all assignments should be submitted as a git repository to ensure that both partners receive similar grades. The syllabus clearly states that assignments should be committed as you develop them, rather than in large commits at the end. This will help ensure that both partners receive similar grades.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does provide guidance on how to approach the assignments to ensure that both partners receive similar grades. The syllabus states that both partners should contribute equally to each assignment, and that it is not acceptable for one partner to do all the work on any assignment. To ensure that both partners are contributing equally, it's important to communicate with your partner throughout the assignment process and to divide the workload evenly.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
