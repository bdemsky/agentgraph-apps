  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question regarding the assignments in EECS 114. I appreciate your proactive approach to ensuring you understand the requirements of the course.

Upon reviewing the syllabus, I can inform you that the format and requirements for the assignments are clearly outlined in section 4.1 of the syllabus. Specifically, it states that "Programs must be well documented with useful comments. Excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points."

Additionally, the syllabus mentions that the assignments will be evaluated based on a rubric that will be provided with each assignment. This rubric will outline the specific criteria and guidelines for each assignment.

If you have any further questions or concerns after reviewing the syllabus, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am always here to help.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
