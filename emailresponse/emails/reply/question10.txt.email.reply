  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question about the assignments in EECS 114. I'm happy to help you.

The format of the assignments in the course will be coding challenges, where you will be given a set of problems to solve and will need to submit your code for evaluation. The assignments will be evaluated based on the quality of your code, including factors such as readability, commenting, and functionality.

Regarding the 50% weightage allocated to assignments in the grading policy, it is important to note that the assignments will be graded based on the quality of your code and your understanding of the concepts covered in the course. The assignments are designed to test your ability to apply the concepts learned in the course to real-world problems, and the grading will reflect this.

You can find more information about the assignments in the course syllabus, which is available on the course website at <http://eee.uci.edu/10f/18090/>. Specifically, section 4.2 of the syllabus outlines the requirements for commenting code, and section 5 lists the different components of the course and their weightage in the grading policy.

I hope this information helps answer your question. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
