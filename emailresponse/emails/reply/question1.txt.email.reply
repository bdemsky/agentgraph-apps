  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a draft email response to the student's question:

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I'm happy to help answer your questions.

Regarding your question about commenting code in the assignments, the syllabus does provide some guidance on this topic. In section 4.1, it states that programs must be well documented with useful comments. The syllabus defines "useful" comments as comments that provide clear explanations of what the code is doing, rather than just remarks that are redundant or unnecessary.

In terms of specific requirements for commenting code, the syllabus does not provide any specific guidelines beyond the general requirement for well-documented code. However, I would recommend consulting the course's textbook and other resources for additional information on commenting code in Java programming.

Regarding your second question about the software and tools we will be using in the course, the syllabus does not provide any specific information on this topic. However, as you mentioned in your email, Android is the platform used for this course. In terms of software and tools, we will be using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing and testing Android applications.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
