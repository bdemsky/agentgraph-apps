  Subject: Re: Questions about Midterm in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the midterm exam. I appreciate your proactive approach to preparing for the exam.

To answer your first question, the midterm exam will be held on Tuesday, April 18th from 8:00-9:20am in RH104. The format of the midterm will be a written exam, and it will cover the material discussed in the lectures and slides up to that point in the quarter.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not provide details about the specific topics or concepts that will be covered on the midterm. However, I suggest you review the entire course material and slides to ensure you are well-prepared for the exam.

For additional resources and study materials, I recommend using the course edstem page and the online resources provided in the syllabus. You can also attend the lectures and discussions to get a better understanding of the material.

I hope this information helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,
Brian Demsky
