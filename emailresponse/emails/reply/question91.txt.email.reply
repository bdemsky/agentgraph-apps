  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in COMPSCI 295: Advanced Concurrency. I'm happy to help you.

Regarding the lecture slides, I can inform you that the topics that will be covered in the course are listed in the syllabus, which you can access through the course Google drive folder link provided in the syllabus. The level of detail provided in the slides will depend on the complexity of the topics, but I assure you that the material is designed to be comprehensive and informative.

As for the book required for the course, The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, the version published in June 2012 is the only one required for the course. However, I encourage you to use any version of the book that you have access to, as the concepts and techniques discussed in the book are fundamental to the course.

Regarding academic honesty, I appreciate your concern. Please note that the syllabus provides detailed information on the academic honesty policy in the course. I can not answer your question at this time.

In terms of resources available to help you avoid plagiarism, you can use the University of California, Irvine's guidelines on academic integrity, which are available on the UCI Academic Integrity website. Additionally, you can use plagiarism detection tools provided by the course or the university to ensure the originality of your work.

I hope this information helps, John. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
