  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your questions about the assignments in EECS 40. I apologize, but the weightage of the assignments in the course grade is not specified in the syllabus. However, I can tell you that the assignments are worth a total of 50% of the course grade, as stated in the syllabus.

Regarding your request to submit assignments on a non-lab day, the syllabus does not provide any information on this matter. As a general rule, assignments are to be submitted on the designated lab days, and late assignments will receive reduced credit. However, if you are unable to make it to the designated lab session due to unforeseen circumstances, you may want to speak with the instructor or TA to discuss possible alternatives.

I hope this information helps. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
