  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I'm happy to help you with your questions.

To answer your first question, the assignments in EECS 221 will be a combination of programming and written assignments. The specific topics and areas of focus will be provided in the course materials and will be based on the research papers we will be reading and discussing in class.

Regarding the tools and software you will be using for the assignments, we will be using a variety of programming languages and debugging tools, including but not limited to:

* Python
* Java
* C++
* Debugging tools such as GDB, Valgrind, and the like

As for the grading policy, the assignments will be weighted as follows:

* Final examination: 30%
* Homeworks/Projects: 60%
* Participation: 10%

Regarding late submissions, there will be penalties for late submissions. Late submissions will be penalized by 10% per day, up to a maximum of 50%.

Unfortunately, the answer to your last question cannot be found in the syllabus. I can not answer your question at this time.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
