  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question regarding the assignments in EECS 114. I apologize for any confusion, and I'm happy to help you.

According to the syllabus, the assignments in the course are worth 50% of the total grade. This is listed in section 4.1 of the syllabus, which states, "Assignments must be turned in on time. Late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. Assignments are worth 50% of the total grade."

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not provide specific guidelines or requirements for the assignments beyond "well-documented with useful comments." However, it is important to note that all programs must be documented with useful comments to receive full credit.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
