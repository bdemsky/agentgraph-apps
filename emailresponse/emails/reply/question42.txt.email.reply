  Subject: Re: Query on Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions regarding the assignments in EECS 114. I appreciate your eagerness to learn the course materials and prepare for the assignments.

To answer your first question, the format and file submission requirements for the assignments are clearly outlined in section 4.2 of the syllabus, which states that all assignments must be submitted electronically while logged into the server. Additionally, the syllabus mentions that programs must be well documented with useful comments, and that excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not provide specific guidelines or restrictions for the style and structure of the comments. However, it is important to note that the assignments will be graded on the quality and clarity of the comments, as well as the correctness of the code. Therefore, it is essential to provide clear and concise comments that are easy to understand and follow.

Finally, the syllabus does not mention any specific topics or concepts that should be focused on in the assignments, or any particular programming languages or tools that should be used. However, the course will cover a wide range of topics in computer science and algorithms, and the assignments will be designed to reinforce these concepts.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
