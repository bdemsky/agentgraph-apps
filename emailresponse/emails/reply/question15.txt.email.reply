  Subject: Re: Questions about Lectures in the Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters Course Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the lectures in our Computer Science 142A course.

To answer your first question, the lectures on "Scanning" and "Parsing part 1" will cover the basics of these topics, including the fundamental concepts and techniques of scanning and parsing. While we may touch on some more advanced topics, the primary focus of these lectures will be on providing a solid foundation for understanding these fundamental concepts.

Regarding your second question, we will indeed be discussing specific scanning and parsing algorithms during these lectures, including context-free grammars, top-down vs. bottom-up parsing, and other relevant topics.

As for the location of the lectures, they will be held in RH104, which is located on the first floor of the ICS building. You can find a map of the campus and the location of RH104 on our course edstem page or by visiting the UCI campus map website.

I hope this information helps, John. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
