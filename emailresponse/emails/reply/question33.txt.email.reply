  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your question about the assignments in EECS 40. I appreciate your interest in ensuring that your code is well documented.

To answer your question, the syllabus does provide some guidance on what constitutes "useful comments" in the context of the assignments. According to section 4.1 of the syllabus, programs must be well documented with useful comments. This means that your code should include comments that explain the logic and purpose of each section of code, as well as any assumptions or constraints that are relevant to the assignment.

The syllabus does not provide specific formatting or structure requirements for the comments, but it does emphasize that the comments should be detailed and provide useful information.

Unfortunately, I cannot answer your question at this time as the syllabus does not provide a clear answer to your question. However, I encourage you to review the syllabus and consult with your teaching assistant or instructor if you have any further questions or concerns.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
