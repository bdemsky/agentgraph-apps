  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I'm happy to help answer your questions.

To address your first question, the syllabus does not provide any additional details on the weightage of assignments in the course beyond the 50% mentioned in the syllabus. Therefore, I can not provide any clarification on this matter.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does state that late assignments will receive reduced credit, but it does not provide any exceptions to this rule. Therefore, I can not confirm whether it is possible to submit assignments late without incurring any penalties.

Finally, the syllabus does require that assignments be submitted to the group's CVS repository. This means that you will need to create a new repository for your group, or use an existing one. You can find more information on how to submit assignments to the repository in the course website.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
