  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the EECS 114 course. I'm happy to help.

To answer your first question, the syllabus does provide some guidance on what constitutes a late assignment. According to section 4.1, assignments must be turned in on time, and late assignments may not be graded and may receive no credit. The syllabus does not provide any specific grace periods or extensions for late assignments, so it's important to plan accordingly and submit your work on time.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does mention that the assignments will be primarily programming assignments, but it also notes that there may be other types of assignments as well. However, the syllabus does not provide detailed information on the specific types of assignments you can expect throughout the course.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
