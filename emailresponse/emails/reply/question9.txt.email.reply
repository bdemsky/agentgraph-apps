  Subject: Re: Question about Homework in EECS 114

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I appreciate your attention to detail regarding the homework assignments in EECS 114.

To answer your question, the syllabus does provide some guidance on the commenting requirements for the programs you submit. In section 4.1, it states that programs must be well documented with useful comments. While the syllabus does not provide a specific number of comments required for each assignment, it does emphasize that the comments should be useful and not excessive, insufficient, or useless.

In terms of formatting, the syllabus does not provide any specific guidelines for the comments. However, it is important to keep in mind that the comments should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for anyone reviewing the code.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
