  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in EECS 221

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the assignments in EECS 221. I apologize, but I can not answer your question at this time as the information you are seeking is not available in the course syllabus.

However, I would like to direct you to the course syllabus, which provides a comprehensive overview of the course policies and expectations. The syllabus outlines the course objectives, meeting times, and assignments, as well as the grading policy and academic honesty guidelines.

Regarding your specific questions, the syllabus does not indicate any specific programming language requirements for the assignments, but it does mention that the assignments will involve static and dynamic analysis of code, debugging tools, code visualization tools, and techniques to recover from software failures.

In terms of tools and software required for the assignments, the syllabus does not provide any specific information. However, you may need to use certain tools and software for your assignments, and I will provide more information on that during the course.

Finally, the syllabus does not provide any guidelines or rubrics for completing the assignments. However, I will provide detailed instructions and expectations for each assignment, and you will be expected to complete the assignments to the best of your abilities based on those instructions.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
