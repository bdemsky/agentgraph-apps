  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in COMPSCI 295 - Advanced Concurrency

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the course. I appreciate your eagerness to understand the course requirements and academic honesty policy.

To answer your first question, the syllabus does provide some guidelines for formatting and organizing the assignments. Specifically, it mentions that the assignments should be submitted in a Google Drive folder, and that the files should be named in a specific format (e.g., "LastName_AssignmentName.zip"). However, I cannot find any specific guidelines or requirements for coding and testing the assignments in the syllabus.

Regarding the course slides, I apologize, but I cannot provide the link to the Google Drive folder at this time. You can find the course slides in the Google Drive folder by logging into your UCI account and accessing the course folder.

Now, regarding your second question, I can assure you that academic honesty is taken very seriously in this course. The syllabus explicitly states that any form of cheating will result in severe consequences, including a failing grade and disciplinary action by the University. It is important to understand that cheating is not limited to copying code from other sources, but also includes presenting work that is not your own, or collaborating with other students on assignments without proper authorization.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I will do my best to assist you.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
