  Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the assignments in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help you.

Regarding your first question, the syllabus does provide guidance on the format for submitting assignments. According to the syllabus, assignments should be committed as a single commit in the repository. This allows us to easily track the development of the code and ensure that it meets the requirements of the assignment.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not specify any specific tools or software that you should use for the assignments. However, it is expected that you will use a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and compile your code.

Finally, the syllabus does provide guidance on the grading criteria for each assignment. The quality of the code will be evaluated based on its clarity, organization, and correctness. The assignment will also be graded on the amount of effort put into it, including the complexity of the code and the amount of research and experimentation done to solve the problem.

I hope this information helps answer your questions. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or your TAs.

Best regards,
Brian Demsky
