  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in the EECS 40 course. I'm happy to help you with your question.

After reviewing the course syllabus, I found that the guidelines and requirements for the assignments are outlined in section 4.1 of the syllabus, which states that "Programs must be well documented with useful comments. Excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the program will result in deducted points."

Additionally, section 4.2 of the syllabus mentions that the platform for the course is Android, and that you will need to have an EECS server account to access the course materials and submit your assignments.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not provide specific guidelines or resources for managing your time and staying organized throughout the course. However, I would recommend using a planner or calendar to keep track of your assignments and deadlines, and setting aside dedicated time each week to work on your assignments. You may also find it helpful to break down larger assignments into smaller tasks and to prioritize your tasks based on their importance and deadlines.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
