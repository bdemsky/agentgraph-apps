  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 40 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for reaching out to me with your questions about the assignments in EECS 40. I'm happy to help you.

1. The format for submitting assignments is specified in the syllabus under the "Assignments" section. According to the syllabus, assignments should be turned in to the course website using the appropriate submission form.
2. The syllabus does not provide specific guidelines for commenting code, but it does mention that programs must be well documented with useful comments. It is important to include comments in your code to help us understand how it works and to avoid deducted points for lack of documentation.
3. According to the syllabus, late assignments will receive reduced credit. The exact penalty for late assignments is not specified in the syllabus, but it is mentioned that it is possible to make alternative arrangements if you are unable to meet a deadline.

I hope this information helps answer your questions. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
