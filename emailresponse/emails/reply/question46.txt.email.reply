  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question about the assignments in EECS 114. I'm happy to help you.

From the syllabus, we can see that the assignments are worth 50% of the course grade, and that they must be turned in on time. The syllabus also mentions that all assignments must be well documented with useful comments, and that excessive, insufficient, or useless comments in the programs will result in deducted points.

However, I apologize, but I cannot answer your question at this time as the syllabus does not provide specific guidelines or examples for what constitutes "excessive, insufficient, or useless comments" in the programs for the assignments. It is possible that this information may be covered in lectures or during office hours, but I cannot confirm that without further examining the course materials.

I recommend that you attend lectures and take advantage of office hours to ask questions and clarify any doubts you may have about the assignments. Additionally, you can review the course website for any additional resources or guidelines that may be available.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
