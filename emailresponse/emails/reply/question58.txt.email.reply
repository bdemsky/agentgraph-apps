  Subject: Re: Question about Midterm in the Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question. I appreciate your diligence in reviewing the course syllabus and seeking clarification on the midterm exam.

To answer your first question, the date, duration, and format of the midterm exam can be found in the course syllabus under the "Midterm & Finals" section. Specifically, it is mentioned that the midterm exam will be held on [insert date and time] and will be worth 10% of the final grade.

Regarding your second question, there will be practice quizzes and exams throughout the quarter to help students prepare for the final exam. However, the specific details of these additional assessments are not listed in the syllabus. I recommend reviewing the course schedule and materials regularly to stay informed of any upcoming assessments.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
