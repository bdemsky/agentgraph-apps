  Subject: Re: Question about Assignments in EECS 114 Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your question about the assignments in EECS 114. I apologize, but the information you are seeking can be found in the course syllabus.

According to section 4.1 of the syllabus, programs must be well documented with useful comments. While the syllabus does not provide a specific definition of what constitutes "useful" comments, it does state that programs with excessive, insufficient, or useless comments may result in deducted points.

Additionally, the syllabus does not specify any specific file formats or programming languages that are required for the assignments. However, it does state that all course work will be checked and graded on the server, so it is important to ensure that your programs are compatible with the platform used for grading.

I hope this information helps answer your question. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
