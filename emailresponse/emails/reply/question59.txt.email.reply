  Subject: Re: Questions about Lectures in the Compiler and Interpreters Course Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the lectures in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help you.

To confirm, the lectures for the course are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:00-9:20 am in RH104, as stated in the syllabus. The lectures will also be recorded and posted online, as mentioned in the syllabus. You can find the recorded lectures on the course's Yuja page.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not provide information on specific topics or areas that will be covered in the lectures beyond what is listed in the course outline. However, I can assure you that the course will cover the material listed in the syllabus, including scanning, parsing, AST/symbol table/type checking, intermediate representation, code generation, and more.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,

Brian Demsky
