  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in Computer Science 142A

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the assignments in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help you.

To answer your first question, yes, you are allowed to submit your assignments as a single commit in the git repository. However, please note that while it is possible, it is not ideal as it may affect the grading criteria. As stated in the syllabus, "Assignments should be turned in on time. If you cannot make a deadline, please email the TAs to make alternative arrangements." Therefore, it is important to communicate with your TAs and make arrangements well in advance.

Regarding your second question, the grading criteria for assignments can be found in the syllabus under the "Grading" section. Specifically, it states that "Late penalty for projects: 5% for the first three days, 8% from three to seven days, and 10% until the end of the quarter." As for the significant disparity in work between partners, the syllabus does not provide a specific percentage or criteria. However, it is expected that both partners will contribute equally to each assignment, and any significant disparity in work may result in a reduced grade or additional penalties.

Finally, the course does provide resources for students who are struggling with the assignments or need additional clarification on certain concepts. The syllabus mentions that "We have lectures that work through developing a simplified compiler. The lectures are available on the course's Yuja page." Additionally, the Discord server for students to chat regarding the class may be useful for seeking help from peers or the TAs.

I hope this information helps, John. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
