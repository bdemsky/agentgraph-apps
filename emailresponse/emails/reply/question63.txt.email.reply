  Subject: Re: Questions about Assignments in the Spring 2023 Compilers and Interpreters Syllabus

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to me with your questions about the assignments in Computer Science 142A. I'm happy to help you.

To answer your first question, the grading policy for assignments submitted late can be found in the syllabus under the "Late Work" section. According to the syllabus, there will be a late penalty of 5% for the first three days, 8% from three to seven days, and 10% until the end of the quarter.

Regarding your second question, the syllabus does not specify any particular tools or techniques that we prefer for developing the compiler. You are free to use any programming language and tools you prefer as long as you follow the guidelines outlined in the syllabus.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

Best regards,
Brian Demsky
