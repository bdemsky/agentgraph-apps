  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. My question is regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be available as part of the course.

Can you please clarify whether the pre-recorded videos will be available for all topics covered in the course, or will they be limited to select topics? Additionally, will the pre-recorded videos include interactive elements, such as quizzes or activities, to help reinforce the material?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
