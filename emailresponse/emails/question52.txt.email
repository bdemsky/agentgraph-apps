Subject: Question about Course Syllabus

Dear Professor [Instructor's Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully reviewed the course syllabus and I appreciate the detailed information provided. However, I have a question regarding the lab meetings mentioned in the syllabus.

In the syllabus, it states that lab meetings will be offered on a selection of days and times throughout the week to provide individualized help on projects and reinforcement exercises. I was wondering if there is a specific schedule for these lab meetings, or if they are held on a drop-in basis? I would like to plan accordingly and ensure that I can attend the lab meetings for additional support.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am looking forward to the start of the course and your guidance throughout the quarter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
