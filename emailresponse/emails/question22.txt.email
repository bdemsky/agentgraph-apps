  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Organization and Grading Policies

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on some aspects of the course syllabus for ICS 45C, specifically the organization of the course and the grading policies.

Firstly, I am curious about the predominantly in-person format of the course. Will there be any virtual sessions or online materials available for students who cannot attend the in-person lectures? Additionally, how will attendance be recorded and graded, and what consequences will there be for non-attendance?

Secondly, I am confused about the weights of the graded artifacts and the determination of final grades. Could you provide more detail on the percentage weights of each assignment and how they will be combined to determine the final grade? Are there any additional factors that will be taken into account, such as participation in online discussions or completion of additional assignments?

Thirdly, I am interested in the accommodations provided for students with disabilities. How can students request accommodations, and what types of accommodations are typically provided?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the academic honesty policies in the course. What constitutes plagiarism, and how will submissions be checked for similarity? Are there any consequences for violating academic honesty policies, and how are these consequences determined?

Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
