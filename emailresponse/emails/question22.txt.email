Subject: Clarification on Reinforcement Exercises

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for ICS 45C and found it to be quite comprehensive. However, I do have one question regarding the reinforcement exercises.

In the syllabus, it mentions that the reinforcement exercises will be released as they become available. Is there a specific schedule for when these exercises will be released? I would like to plan my study time accordingly and ensure that I have enough time to complete each exercise before its corresponding lecture material.

Thank you in advance for your clarification. I appreciate your help.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
