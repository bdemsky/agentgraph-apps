Subject: Clarification on Course Requirements and Grading

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully reviewed the syllabus for the course and I have a question regarding the course requirements and grading.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that attendance is not graded, except on exam days. Does this mean that attending lectures, lab meetings, and office hours is not mandatory for this course? I want to make sure I understand the expectations correctly.

Additionally, the syllabus states that the course grade will be based on programming projects, reinforcement exercises, and a final exam. I noticed that there is no mention of homework assignments. Will there be any homework assigned for this course, or are the reinforcement exercises fulfilling that role?

Thank you for taking the time to clarify these points. I appreciate your assistance in ensuring I have a clear understanding of the course requirements and grading structure.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
