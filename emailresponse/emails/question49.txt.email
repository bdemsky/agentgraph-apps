  Sure, here's an email asking a question about the syllabus:

Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I have reviewed carefully. My question is regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be available as part of the course.

According to the syllabus, "Portions of the lecture material will be pre-recorded and will be available to officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space for ICS 46, in addition to the lecture material that is scheduled to be presented in-person." My question is, will these pre-recorded videos cover the same topics as the in-person lectures, or will they be separate and additional material?

I understand that this may seem like a straightforward question, but I want to make sure I have a clear understanding of the course material before the quarter begins. Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
