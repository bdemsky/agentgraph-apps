Subject: Clarification about Attendance and Virtual Experience

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read the syllabus for ICS 45C and I have a question regarding the attendance and virtual experience requirement.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that physical presence on campus will be required at various points throughout the quarter and that a separate virtual experience will not be guaranteed for students who are not physically attending at those times. However, it also states that portions of the lecture material will be pre-recorded and available to officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space.

I am currently taking another course with a lecture overlap, and I am unable to physically attend the in-person lectures. Will I still have access to the lecture material through the pre-recorded videos? I want to ensure that I can keep up with the course material and not fall behind.

Thank you for your understanding and clarification on this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
