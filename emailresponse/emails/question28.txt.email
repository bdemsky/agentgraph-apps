  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the course syllabus for ICS 45C, which I recently received. As I began reviewing the syllabus, I had a few questions that I could not find answers to after careful reading.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more details on the pre-recorded videos that will be made available throughout the quarter. How will these videos be accessed, and are they a requirement for the course?

Additionally, I was unsure about the weightage of the reinforcement exercises in the course. Could you please provide a breakdown of the percentage distribution of the grades for each assignment?

Lastly, I noticed that the syllabus mentions that academic honesty is a two-way street, and any violations of academic honesty policies will be reported to the UCI Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct. Can you elaborate on what constitutes academic dishonesty in this course, and what are the potential consequences of such violations?

Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing my queries. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
