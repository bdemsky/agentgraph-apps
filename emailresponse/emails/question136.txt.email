  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that I could not find an answer to by reading the document closely. I am a new student in the course and would appreciate your help in clarifying a specific policy.

In the section on "Grade calculation," it is mentioned that the course will be worth 60% of the overall grade, with 30% of that coming from warm-up exercises and 20% from mid-quarter topic exams. However, the syllabus does not provide any information on how the 20% from mid-quarter topic exams will be weighted. Will this 20% be equally weighted with the warm-up exercises, or will it have a different weighting?

Additionally, the syllabus mentions that "Demonstrated Competency of Core Topics at Exams" will be worth 20% of the overall grade. Could you please provide
