  Subject: Questions about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request clarification on a few points regarding the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently reviewed. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I have some questions that can be answered by the course staff.

Firstly, under the "Online Decorum" section, it is mentioned that "While it is not our intent to measure your participation...we are requiring that students meet the decorum requirements described above." Could you please elaborate on what constitutes off-topic discussion in Ed Discussion and how can I avoid posting my solutions to projects or reinforcement exercises?

Secondly, under the "Grading" section, it is mentioned that the course grade will be determined from the weighted combination of scores on each of six programming projects, eight sets of reinforcement exercises, and an in-person Final Exam. Could you please provide more details on the weightage of each component and how the scores will be calculated?

Lastly, under the "Determining final grades" section, it is mentioned that course grades will be determined neither on a normal curve nor a straight scale. Could you please provide more information on how the grades will be determined and what the minimum scores are to receive a particular grade?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to receiving your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
