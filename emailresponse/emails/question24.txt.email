Subject: Course Syllabus Question

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read the syllabus for ICS 45C and it has provided me with a clear overview of the course structure and expectations. However, I do have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises.

In the syllabus, it mentions that the reinforcement exercises will be released as they become available. I was wondering if there is a specific schedule or timeline for when these exercises will be posted? 

Thank you for your assistance,
