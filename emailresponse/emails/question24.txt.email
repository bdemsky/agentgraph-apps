  Subject: Seeking Clarity on Course Organization and Grading Policies

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As I review the course syllabus for ICS 45C, I have a few questions regarding the course organization and grading policies that would be greatly appreciate your clarification.

Firstly, I am curious about the pre-recorded videos that will be available for certain topics. Will these videos be available for all students, or will they be restricted to certain groups? Additionally, how will these videos be graded, and will they contribute to the overall course grade?

Secondly, the syllabus mentions that there will be online decorum, and that any behavior deemed offensive or disruptive will result in repercussions. Could you provide more details on what constitutes offensive or disruptive behavior, and what the consequences might be?

Thirdly, I am concerned about the weightage given to each programming project and reinforcement exercises. Will there be any opportunity for students to submit their work for feedback before the final submission date, and how will the feedback be provided?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the academic honesty policy and the consequences of violating it. How will plagiarism be detected, and what are the potential penalties for academic dishonesty?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
