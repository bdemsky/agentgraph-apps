  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Organization and Policies

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As I begin preparing for ICS 45C, I am reaching out to request clarification on some aspects of the course organization and policies. As a student who is eager to make the most of this opportunity, I would like to ensure that I am fully aware of the expectations and guidelines set forth in the syllabus.

Specifically, I have the following questions:

1. What constitutes an "in-person format" for the course, and how will the lectures and other activities be delivered? Will there be any online components or virtual meetings?
2. Can you elaborate on the "pre-recorded videos" mentioned in the syllabus? Are these videos available for viewing at any time, or are they only available during specific lectures or meetings?
3. How will the "reinforcement exercises" contribute to my overall grade, and what is the weightage assigned to each reinforcement exercise?
4. Are there any specific guidelines or resources available for students who may need accommodations due to disabilities? How can they request these accommodations, and what is the process for receiving them?
5. Can you provide more information on the "Final Exam" mentioned in the syllabus? What is the format of the exam, and how will it be administered?

I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on these points. As a responsible and motivated student, I want to ensure that I am fully prepared for the course and can meet all the expectations set forth by the instructor. Your guidance is essential in helping me navigate this course successfully.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
