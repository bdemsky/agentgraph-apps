Dear Professor,

I have read through the syllabus for this course and I have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises. In the syllabus, it is mentioned that the exercises will be released as they are available. I was wondering if there is a specific schedule or timeline for when we can expect these exercises to be available.

Thank you,
John Smith
