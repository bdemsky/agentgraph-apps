Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course and I have a question regarding the online participation and decorum policy.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that deductions of up to 10% may be made from a student's grade for behavior that does not follow the decorum requirements. I understand the importance of maintaining a respectful and collegial environment, but I was wondering if you could provide some examples of the types of behavior that would warrant such deductions. It would be helpful to have a clearer understanding of the expectations in order to ensure that I am meeting them.

Thank you for your time and clarification. 

Best regards,
John Smith
