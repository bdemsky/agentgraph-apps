  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Requirements and Policies

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the course requirements and policies outlined in the syllabus for ICS 45C, specifically regarding the pre-recorded videos, online decorum, and academic honesty.

Could you please clarify the following:

1. What percentage of the course grade will be contributed by the pre-recorded videos, and how will they be accessed? Are they available through Canvas, YuJa, or another platform?
2. Are there any specific guidelines or expectations for online decorum? How will we be held accountable for maintaining a respectful and professional atmosphere in our online interactions?
3. Can you provide more detail on what constitutes academic dishonesty, and what consequences can we expect if we violate the academic honesty policies? Are there any resources available to help us understand what is expected of us?

Thank you in advance for your time and attention to my questions. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
