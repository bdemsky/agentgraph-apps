Subject: Clarification on Course Format and Grading Policies

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for our ICS 46 course and I have a question regarding the course format and grading policies.

Regarding the course organization, I understand that this course will be predominantly administered in an in-person format, but with certain online components. My question is, if I am unable to attend the in-person lectures for some reason, will there be alternative virtual options or recordings available for me to access the lecture material? I understand that attendance is not graded, but I want to ensure that I don't miss any important content.

Additionally, in the description of grading, you mentioned that online participation and decorum are required, and violations may result in deductions from our grade. Could you please provide more information on what constitutes appropriate online participation and decorum? I want to ensure that I meet the course expectations and maintain a positive learning environment for everyone.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to address my questions. I appreciate your guidance and clarification on these matters.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
