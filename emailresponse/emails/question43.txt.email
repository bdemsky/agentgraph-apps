  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. My question can be answered by reading the syllabus closely, and I would greatly appreciate your clarification.

In the section "Online Decorum," it is stated that "While it is not our intent to measure your participation...we are requiring that students meet the decorum requirements described above. We reserve the right to deduct as much as 10% from a student's grade when their behavior does not follow those decorum requirements, with repeated or severe violations warranting larger-sized deductions."

My question is, what constitutes a "repeat[ed] or severe violation" of the online decorum requirements? Are there any specific examples of behavior that would fall under this category, or is it entirely at the discretion of the course staff?

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
