  Subject: Seeking Clarification on ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on the ICS 45C syllabus for the upcoming quarter. As I carefully read through the syllabus, I have a few questions that I would like to address before the course begins.

Firstly, I am unsure about the format of the course. Will it be primarily in-person, or will there be any online components? Additionally, are there any virtual sessions or online meetings that I need to attend?

Secondly, I am curious about the pre-recorded videos mentioned in the syllabus. How will these be made available, and will they be a requirement for the course?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the grading structure and weights of the different assignments. Can you provide me with a breakdown of the percentages for each category?

Thank you for your time and attention to my questions. I look forward to receiving your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
