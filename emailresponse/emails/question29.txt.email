Subject: Clarification on Course Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the course syllabus for ICS 45C, and overall, it provides a clear overview of the course structure and expectations. However, I would like to seek clarification on one specific point:

Regarding the lab meetings, it states that there are no scheduled lab sections in this course, but in-person lab meetings will be offered on selected days and times throughout the week. Could you please provide some more details about these lab meetings? Specifically, I would like to know the exact dates, times, and locations where these meetings will take place. Additionally, will attendance at these lab meetings be mandatory or optional?

Thank you for your assistance in providing further clarification on this matter. I appreciate your time and look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
