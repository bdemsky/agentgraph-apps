Subject: Clarification on Course Policies and Online Participation

Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course, but I still have a question regarding the online participation and decorum requirements.

After reading the syllabus closely, I understand that online participation will not be specifically measured, such as attending lectures or watching pre-recorded videos. However, I wanted to clarify the expectation for online participation in terms of engaging with the course materials and discussions. Could you provide some guidance on what would be considered adequate online participation to meet the course requirements?

Additionally, I would appreciate further clarification on the decorum requirements for the online spaces, as mentioned in the syllabus. While I understand the importance of maintaining a respectful environment and avoiding offensive or disrespectful behavior, I was wondering if there are any specific examples or guidelines for appropriate online conduct that you could provide.

Thank you for taking the time to address my questions. I believe a clear understanding of these course policies will greatly contribute to my overall success in this class. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
