  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently reviewed. I have a specific question that cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely, and I would appreciate your clarification.

In the section "Reinforcement Exercises," it is mentioned that we will not be measured on how well we complete the reinforcement exercises, but they will contribute to our overall grade. Can you please clarify what you mean by "contribute to our overall grade"? Will the reinforcement exercises have a direct impact on our final grade, or will they be taken into account in some other way?

Thank you in advance for your time and response. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
