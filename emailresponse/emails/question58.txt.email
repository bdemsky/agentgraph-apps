Subject: Clarification on Course Requirements

Dear Professor [Instructor's Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for the course and I appreciate the thorough explanation of the course structure and requirements. I do have one question that I could not find the answer to in the syllabus.

Regarding the in-person lab meetings, I understand that they are available for individualized help on projects and reinforcement exercises. However, I am curious to know if there is a specific attendance requirement for these lab meetings. Are students expected to attend a certain number of lab meetings throughout the quarter, or is attendance at these meetings completely optional?

Thank you in advance for taking the time to address my question. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
