  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. My question is regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be available for certain lectures.

Can you please clarify whether the pre-recorded videos will be available to officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space? I noticed that the syllabus mentions that some lectures will be recorded and made available on YuJa, but it's not clear if this applies to all lectures or just certain ones.

Additionally, will the pre-recorded videos be available prior to the lectures they correspond to? I want to make sure I can review the material before the lecture to get the most out of it.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
