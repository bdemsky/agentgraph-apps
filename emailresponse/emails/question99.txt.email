  Subject: Seeking Clarification on ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on certain points regarding the syllabus for ICS 45C, which I recently received. As I reviewed the syllabus, I had some questions regarding the following points:

1. In-person format: Can you clarify whether the course will be primarily in-person or will there be any virtual sessions?
2. Required equipment: Could you provide more details on the types of equipment that are necessary for the course?
3. Pre-recorded videos: How many pre-recorded videos are expected to be available, and will they be listed in the syllabus?
4. Online decorum: Could you elaborate on what constitutes offensive behavior and how will it be enforced?
5. Reinforcement exercises: How many sets of reinforcement exercises are expected, and will they be available throughout the quarter?
6. Accommodations for disabilities: How should students who require accommodations due to a disability contact you and the Disability Services Center?
7. Determining final grades: Could you provide more information on the grading criteria and how final grades will be determined?

I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide answers to these questions as soon as possible. I am eager to start the course and want to ensure that I understand the expectations and requirements.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
