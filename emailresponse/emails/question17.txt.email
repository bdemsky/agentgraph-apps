Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for our course, and I have a question about the grading policy.

In the syllabus, it states that the Final Exam is weighted at 38% of the course grade. I was wondering if the Final Exam is cumulative, covering all the lecture material throughout the quarter, or if it will only focus on the content after the previous graded programming projects.

Thank you for clarifying this for me.

Sincerely,
Emily Smith
