  Subject: Questions about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I have carefully read through the syllabus for ICS 46, and I have a question regarding the course organization. Specifically, I am curious about the format of the in-person lectures and how they will be administered. Will the lectures be held in a traditional classroom setting, or will there be a more flexible format to accommodate different learning styles? Additionally, will there be any opportunities for students to ask questions or engage in discussions during the lectures?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
