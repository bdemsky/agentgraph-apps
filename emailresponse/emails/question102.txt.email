  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that I believe cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely.

In the section "Pre-recorded videos," it is stated that "Portions of the lecture material will be pre-recorded and will be available to officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space for ICS 46, in addition to the lecture material that is scheduled to be presented in-person." My question is, will these pre-recorded videos include any additional content that is not covered in the in-person lectures?

I understand that the syllabus provides a detailed outline of the topics that will be covered in the course, but I want to make sure that I have access to all the necessary material to succeed in the course. Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
