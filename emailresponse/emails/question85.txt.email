  Subject: Seeking Clarity on Syllabus for ICS 45C - Spring 2023

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As I begin my journey in ICS 45C this spring, I am reaching out to request clarification on a few aspects of the course syllabus. My name is [Your Name], and I am eager to learn and excel in this program.

1. Lecture and Exam Schedule: Could you please provide me with the detailed lecture and exam schedule for the course? I want to ensure that I am available for all sessions and can manage my time effectively.
2. Pre-Recorded Videos: How will the pre-recorded videos be made available? Will they be linked through the Canvas course space, and if so, how can I access them?
3. Online Decorum: Could you elaborate on the online decorum policy? As a responsible and respectful student, I want to ensure that I maintain a professional online presence throughout the course.
4. Grading Weightage: Could you please provide me with the weightage of each assessment component in the course? This will help me focus my efforts on the areas that carry the most significance in terms of grading.
5. Accommodations for Disabilities: Are there any specific instructions or procedures that I need to follow if I require accommodations for a disability? Please feel free to share any additional resources or support services that may be available.

Your prompt response to my queries will be greatly appreciated. I am excited to learn from you and my fellow classmates in ICS 45C, and I look forward to a productive and fulfilling spring semester.

Thank you,
