  Subject: Questions about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask some questions about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. I have read through the syllabus carefully, but I have some questions that I hope you can clarify.

Firstly, under the "Lecture" section, it is mentioned that lectures will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:30-7:50 pm. However, the schedule also lists some lectures as having exams on those days. Could you please clarify whether these lectures are the ones that will have exams, or are they just regular lectures?

Secondly, under the "Pre-recorded videos" section, it is mentioned that some lectures will be pre-recorded and available online. How will we know which lectures are available online, and will they be available to watch before the in-person lectures?

Lastly, under the "Online participation" section, it is mentioned that there will be online decorum, and any behavior that does not meet the decorum requirements may result in a deduction of up to 10% from the final grade. Could you please elaborate on what constitutes offensive or disrespectful behavior online, and what kind of consequences we can expect if we violate the decorum requirements?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
