Subject: Paul Ramone - Question About Research Assistant Oppurtunity
Body:
Hi Professor:

My name is Paul Ramone and I am in your ICS45C course. I am reaching out to you because I really enjoy your course and especially enjoy learning about the C++ langauge. I really like your teaching style and I was wondering if you had any ongoing research that I could assist you with. 


Sincerely,
Paul Ramone
