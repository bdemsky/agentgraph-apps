Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course and I found it to be very informative. However, I do have a question regarding the in-person format of the course.

Given the current circumstances with the ongoing pandemic, I was wondering if there is a possibility for a hybrid or online option for students who are unable to attend the in-person sessions due to health concerns or other reasons. I understand that the syllabus states that there will not be a separate virtual experience for students who are not physically attending, but I wanted to inquire if any accommodations can be made considering the circumstances.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
John Smith
