  Subject: Questions about the ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I am writing to seek clarification on some points from the ICS 45C syllabus for the upcoming quarter. As I carefully reviewed the syllabus, I have some questions that I hope you can help me with.

Firstly, I am unsure about the formatting and organization of the Notes and Examples section. Will they be provided in a separate document or embedded within the Canvas course space? Additionally, will there be any specific requirements or guidelines for formatting and organizing my work?

Secondly, I am curious about the pre-recorded videos and their availability. Will they be made available on YuJa, and if so, how will I access them? Are there any specific dates or times when the videos will be made available?

Lastly, I would like to inquire about the Online Participation and Decorum section. What constitutes appropriate online behavior, and are there any consequences for not adhering to these expectations?

Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing my questions. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
