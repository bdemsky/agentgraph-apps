Subject: Inquiry about ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I have thoroughly read the syllabus for ICS 45C and I found it to be quite comprehensive. However, I do have one question that I could not find the answer to in the syllabus. I was hoping you could clarify it for me.

In regards to the reinforcement exercises, it is mentioned that they are released when they are available. Could you please provide some more information on when we can expect these exercises to be available?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
