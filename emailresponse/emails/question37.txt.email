  Subject: Questions about ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I am writing to ask for clarification on some of the points mentioned in the ICS 45C syllabus for the upcoming quarter. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I have a few questions that I would like to clarify before the course begins.

Firstly, I am unsure about the format of the course. Will it be primarily in-person, or will there be any online components?

Secondly, could you provide more details about the pre-recorded videos and how they will be administered? Will they be available on Canvas, and how often can we expect to watch them?

Thirdly, I am curious about the reinforcement exercises. How many sets of exercises will there be throughout the quarter, and how often are we expected to complete them?

Lastly, I want to confirm the grading policy. What is the weightage of each programming project, reinforcement exercise, and final exam in determining the final grade? Are there any deductions for online participation and decorum?

Thank you for your time and attention to my questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
