Subject: Clarification on Course Policies

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the course syllabus for ICS 45C, and overall, it provides comprehensive information about the course organization and requirements. However, I do have a few questions that may benefit from additional clarification from you. 

1. Pre-recorded Videos: I understand that a majority of the lecture material will be presented in-person. However, I'm curious about the extent of the pre-recorded videos. Will they cover important lecture content that will not be covered in-person? Are there specific topics or concepts that will be emphasized in the pre-recorded videos that I should prioritize watching?

2. Lab Meetings: As there are no scheduled lab sections, can you please provide more details about the in-person lab meetings? Are they optional, or is attendance strongly recommended? When and where will these meetings be held? 

3. Grading: I appreciate the breakdown of weighted artifacts for determining the course grade. However, I would like to understand how the reinforcement exercises contribute to the final grade. Are they graded solely based on completion, or will they be evaluated for correctness as well?

Thank you for taking the time to address my questions. I want to ensure that I fully understand the expectations and requirements of the course, so your clarification will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
