  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Syllabus for ICS 45C

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the course syllabus for ICS 45C, which I recently received. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I have a few questions that I would like to discuss with you.

Firstly, I am unsure about the format of the course. Will it be primarily in-person, with some online components? Or will it be entirely online? Additionally, I am interested in knowing more about the pre-recorded videos that will be available, and how they will be used in the course.

Secondly, I am curious about the reinforcement exercises mentioned in the syllabus. How many sets of reinforcement exercises will there be, and how will they be graded? Will they be worth a significant amount towards our final grade?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the online participation and decorum expectations. What kind of behavior is expected of us during online meetings and discussions? Are there any specific guidelines or resources available for maintaining appropriate online etiquette?

I appreciate your time and attention to these questions. I am excited to learn more about the course and look forward to your response.

Thank you,

[Your Name]
