  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that I cannot seem to find an answer to by reading it closely. I was wondering if you could help clarify something for me.

In the section on "Online decorum," it is mentioned that "While it is not our intent to measure your participation — in the sense that we won't be tracking whether you're attending the lectures, watching pre-recorded videos, attending the lab sessions, and so on — we are requiring that students meet the decorum requirements described above."

My question is, will we still be required to attend the lectures and lab sessions in person, even if we choose to watch the pre-recorded videos? Will watching the pre-recorded videos somehow replace in-person attendance, or will we still be required to attend both?

Thank you in advance for your time and clarification.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
