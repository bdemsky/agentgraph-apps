Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully reviewed the syllabus for the course, and I have a question regarding accommodations for disabilities.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that students who feel they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact you privately to discuss their specific needs. However, I could not find any information about how and when to contact you regarding this matter. Could you please provide me with the details or direct me to the appropriate resource for requesting accommodations?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
Emma Thompson
