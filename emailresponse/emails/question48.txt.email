  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the syllabus for ICS 46, which I have reviewed carefully. My question is regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be available as part of the course.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that "pre-recorded videos will be available to officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space for ICS 46." However, it is not clear whether these videos will be available to students before the first day of class, or if they will be made available at a later time. Could you please provide more information on when these videos will be available?

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
