Subject: Clarification on Course Syllabus

Dear [Instructor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for our course, and I appreciate the detailed information provided. However, I have a question that I couldn't find the answer to in the syllabus.

Regarding the reinforcement exercises, it is mentioned that they contribute to our grade. Could you please clarify if the exercises will be graded based on completion or if there will be specific criteria we need to meet in order to receive full credit? I want to ensure that I fully understand how these exercises will impact my overall performance in the course.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
