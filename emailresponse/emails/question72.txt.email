  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask some questions about the syllabus for ICS 32A, which I recently received. I have read through the syllabus carefully, but I have a few questions that cannot be answered by reading the document alone.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more information about the pre-recorded videos that will be available for some lectures. How will these videos be made available, and will they be mandatory to watch?

Secondly, under the "Labs" section, it is mentioned that attendance will be taken at the ICS 32A Help Center. What constitutes as attendance, and how will attendance be taken?

Lastly, under the "Grading" section, it is mentioned that the weights of graded artifacts will be determined from the weighted combination of programming projects, reinforcement exercises, and an in-person Final Exam. Can you provide more details about the weightage given to each component, and how the final grade will be calculated?

I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
