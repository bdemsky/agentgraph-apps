  Subject: Question on CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question regarding the CompSci 161 syllabus for the current quarter. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have a question that can be answered by reading the document closely.

My question is regarding the grading policies for the course. specifically, I am curious about the weightage of warm-up exercises in the course and how they are submitted for grading. Are these exercises submitted through GradeScope, and if so, what is the process for submitting them?

Additionally, I would like to know if there are any specific guidelines for addressing a question in a GradeScope submission, or if I should provide a detailed explanation for my answer.

Thank you for your time and assistance in answering my question. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
