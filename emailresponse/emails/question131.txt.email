  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that I would like to inquire about. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I am still unsure about something.

My question is regarding the grading policies for the course. Specifically, I am wondering if you could clarify the weightage of the mid-quarter topic exams and the demonstrated competency of core topics at exams. Are these weights subject to change throughout the quarter, or are they fixed?

Additionally, I would like to know if there are any opportunities for extra credit in the course, and if so, how to access them.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
