  Subject: Questions about ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on some points mentioned in the ICS 45C syllabus for the upcoming quarter. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I have some questions that I would like to discuss with you.

Firstly, I am confused about the format of the course. The syllabus mentions that the course will be administered in a predominantly in-person format, but it also mentions that there will be online elements. Could you please clarify what these online elements entail and how they will be used throughout the quarter?

Secondly, I am interested in knowing more about the lecture material and how it will be covered. The syllabus mentions that the course will cover various topics, but it does not provide a detailed breakdown of what each topic will entail. Could you please provide more information on the topics that will be covered and how they will be organized throughout the quarter?

Thirdly, I am curious about the pre-recorded videos that will be available on YuJa. How will these videos be used to supplement the in-person lectures, and will they be mandatory to watch?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the online decorum policy. The syllabus mentions that there will be consequences for students who do not meet the decorum requirements, but it does not provide much detail on what these consequences entail. Could you please provide more information on what is expected of us in terms of online behavior and how we can maintain decorum throughout the quarter?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
