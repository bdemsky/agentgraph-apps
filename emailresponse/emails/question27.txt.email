Subject: Question about the Syllabus

Dear [Instructor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for ICS 45C and I have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that the reinforcement exercises will be released as they become available. I was wondering if there is a specific schedule or deadline for completing these exercises? Will they be marked as complete once submitted or will there be opportunities for revision?

Thank you for your clarification on this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
