  Subject: Questions about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I have read through the syllabus for ICS 46 and have a question regarding the course organization. Specifically, I am curious about the pre-recorded videos that will be available through YuJa. Will these videos be available for all topics covered in the course, or will they only be available for certain lectures or topics?

Additionally, I was wondering if you could provide more detail on the online decorum policy. What constitutes offensive or disrespectful behavior that could result in a deduction from my grade?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
