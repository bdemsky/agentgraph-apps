  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the ICS 32A syllabus for the upcoming quarter.

Firstly, I am curious to know if there will be any in-person sessions held outside of the scheduled lecture and lab times listed in the syllabus. I understand that the course is primarily in-person, but I want to make sure I am aware of any additional meetings that may take place.

Secondly, the syllabus mentions that attendance will be taken at the Final Exam, but it does not provide any information on what constitutes an acceptable level of attendance. Could you please clarify what is expected of us in terms of attendance for the Final Exam?

Lastly, I was wondering if there are any resources available for students who may need accommodations due to disabilities. I want to make sure I am aware of any support services that may be available to me if needed.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
