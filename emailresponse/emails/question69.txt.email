  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As I begin my journey in ICS 32A, I have a few questions about the syllabus that I would like clarified.

Firstly, I noticed that the course will be administered primarily in-person. Will there be any opportunities for remote participation, such as online lectures or virtual office hours, in case of unforeseen circumstances or personal reasons?

Secondly, the syllabus mentions that attendance is not graded but is recommended. Can you elaborate on what constitutes attendance and how it will be monitored? Will attendance be taken during lectures or can students attend at any time?

Thirdly, the course website and Canvas course space will be used to communicate important information and assignments. How often can students expect to receive updates and assignments through these platforms, and how can they stay organized and on track throughout the quarter?

Lastly, the syllabus mentions that there are no textbooks required for the course, but students have the option to use their own supplemental materials. Can you provide more information on what types of resources are recommended or expected, and how they will be used in the course?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to a productive and informative quarter in ICS 32A.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
