  Subject: Questions about ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to ask for clarification on certain points regarding the ICS 45C syllabus that I recently received. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I would like to confirm the following:

1. You mention that the course will be administered primarily in-person, but there are also pre-recorded videos available for certain lectures. How much of the course content will be delivered through pre-recorded videos, and will these videos be available to students who are unable to attend the in-person lectures?
2. You mention that there will be online decorum expectations in place, but do not provide details on what constitutes offensive or disrespectful behavior. Could you please provide more information on what is expected of students in terms of online etiquette?
3. For the reinforcement exercises, are they intended to assess our understanding of each topic, or are they more of a measure of our ability to apply what we have learned? How will these exercises contribute to our overall course grade?
4. You mention that there will be in-person lab meetings available for students to receive individualized help on their projects and reinforcement exercises. How often will these meetings be held, and will they be held at the same time every week?
5. Can you provide more information on the grading scale and weighting of the different components of the course? How will participation and decorum be factored into the final grade?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
