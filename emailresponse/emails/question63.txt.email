  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask some questions about the syllabus for ICS 32A, which I recently received. I have read through the syllabus carefully, but I would like some clarification on a few points.

Firstly, I am confused about the format of the course. The syllabus mentions that the course is predominantly in-person, but it also mentions that some aspects of the course are administered online. Could you please clarify the balance between in-person and online teaching?

Secondly, I am interested in knowing more about the pre-recorded videos that will be available. How many videos are there, and how will they be made available to students? Will they be linked through the Canvas course space?

Thirdly, I would like to know more about the reinforcement exercises. How many sets of reinforcement exercises are there, and what is the weightage of each set in the overall grading?

Lastly, I have a question about the attendance policy. The syllabus mentions that attendance is not graded, but it also says that attendance is required on the days when exams are held. Could you please clarify the attendance policy?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
