Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for the course, and overall, it seems very clear and informative. However, I do have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises.

In the syllabus, it states that the reinforcement exercises contribute to our grade, but it does not specify how they will be graded or what criteria will be used for evaluation. Could you please provide some clarity on this? I want to make sure I understand how these exercises will be assessed and how they will impact my final grade.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
