Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for our course, and overall, it seems clear to me. However, I do have a question regarding the attendance policy for the Final Exam.

In the syllabus, it states that attendance at the Final Exam is a required part of the course. I understand that if a student cannot attend the exam as scheduled due to a documented illness or incapacitation, an exception may be made. My question is, what kind of documentation is required to support a claim of illness or incapacitation? Would a personal email from a doctor or a medical certificate be sufficient proof?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
