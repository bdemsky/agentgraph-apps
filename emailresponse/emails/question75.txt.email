  Subject: Clarification on Course Requirements and Grading

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the ICS 32A course syllabus. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have some questions regarding the following:

1. In-person format: The syllabus states that the course is predominantly in-person, but it also mentions that some lectures may be pre-recorded and available online. Could you please clarify what percentage of the course will be conducted in-person versus online?
2. Lecture times: The syllabus lists the time for the lecture on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but it does not mention the time for the lecture on Mondays. Could you please provide the time for the Monday lectures?
3. Reinforcement exercises: The syllabus mentions that reinforcement exercises will be released corresponding to each week's lecture material. Could you please clarify what is meant by "corresponding to each week's lecture material"? Will there be exercises for every lecture, or will there be a certain number of exercises per week?
4. Attendance: The syllabus states that attendance is not graded but is recommended. Could you please clarify what is meant by "recommended"? Is attendance required for certain parts of the course, such as the Final Exam?
5. Accommodations: The syllabus mentions that students who may need accommodations based on a disability should contact you privately. Could you please provide more information on the accommodations provided and how to access them?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
