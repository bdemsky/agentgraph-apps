  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have a question regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be available for some lectures. Could you please clarify if these pre-recorded videos will be available for all lectures, or will they be limited to specific topics? Additionally, will these videos be available through the Canvas course space, or will they be linked through a different platform?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
