Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read the syllabus for our course, and I have a question about the attendance policy for the Final Exam.

In the syllabus, it states that attendance at the Final Exam is a required part of our enrollment in the course. I understand that if we have a scheduling conflict, we will need to find another course to enroll in. However, I was wondering if there are any exceptions to this policy in the case of an illness or incapacitation. If a student is unable to attend the exam due to a documented illness, will there be any accommodation made?

Thank you for clarifying this policy for me. I appreciate your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
