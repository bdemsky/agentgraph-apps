  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. My question is regarding the use of pre-recorded videos and their contribution to the course grade.

According to the syllabus, "pre-recorded videos will be available to officially-enrolled students via the Canvas course space for ICS 46." However, it is not clear how these videos will be factored into the course grade. Will they be assigned as homework and worth a percentage of the overall grade, or are they intended to supplement the in-person lectures and reinforcement exercises?

I would greatly appreciate it if you could clarify this point for me. I am eager to get started with the course and want to make sure I understand the expectations for the grade.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
