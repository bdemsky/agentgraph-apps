  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Syllabus for ICS 45C - Spring 2022

Dear Professor [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the syllabus for ICS 45C - Introduction to Computer Systems, which I will be taking this spring. As I read through the syllabus, I noticed the following points that I would like further clarification on:

1. Pre-recorded videos: The syllabus mentions that pre-recorded videos will be available for some of the lecture material. Could you please provide more details on what topics will be covered in these videos and how they will be made available to us?
2. Online participation: The syllabus mentions that attendance is not guaranteed for exams, but it is expected that students will participate in online discussions and activities. Could you please clarify what kind of online activities are expected and how they will be monitored?
3. Lab meetings: The syllabus mentions that lab meetings will be available for individualized help on projects and reinforcement exercises. Could you please provide more information on the schedules and locations of these meetings?
4. Accommodations for disabilities: The syllabus mentions that students who require accommodations based on disabilities should contact the Disability Services Center. Could you please provide more information on the types of accommodations available and how to access them?

I appreciate your time and attention to these questions, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
