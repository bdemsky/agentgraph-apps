Subject: Question about Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for ICS 45C and I have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises.

In the syllabus, it states that there will be eight sets of reinforcement exercises throughout the quarter. Could you please clarify if these exercises will be graded or if they are solely meant for self-assessment?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
