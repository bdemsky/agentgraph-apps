  Subject: Questions on the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask some questions about the course syllabus for ICS 46, Spring 2022. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I would like clarification on a few points.

Firstly, regarding the lecture format, you mention that in-person attendance is not guaranteed for virtual students. Will there be any alternative arrangements made for virtual students to participate in the lectures?

Secondly, for the pre-recorded videos, you mention that they will be available on YuJa, but how will we know which videos are assigned for each week? Will there be a separate calendar or schedule provided?

Lastly, under the "Online Participation" section, you mention that there will be no formalized curve or straight scale for determining final grades. However, you also mention that overall scores above 90% will receive an A- or better, scores above 80% will receive a B- or better, and scores above 70% will receive a C or better. Can you elaborate on what these cutoffs mean and how they will be determined?

Thank you for your time and clarification on these matters. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
