  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Syllabus for ICS 45C - C++ Programming

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to request clarification on a few points regarding the syllabus for ICS 45C - C++ Programming. As I carefully reviewed the syllabus, I have some questions that I couldn't find answers to after reading it closely.

Firstly, I would like to inquire about the pre-recorded videos that will be available for certain lecture material. Will these videos be made available through YuJa, and if so, how can I access them? Additionally, will these videos be graded in any way, or are they purely for supplemental learning?

Secondly, I am uncertain about the weightage of the reinforcement exercises in the overall grade. Are these exercises worth 2% of the total grade, as mentioned in the syllabus, or is the percentage amount subject to change?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the online participation and decorum expectations. How will attendance be monitored for in-person lectures, and what constitutes appropriate behavior in an online setting? Are there any specific tools or platforms that we are expected to use for online communication?

I appreciate your time and attention to these questions, and I look forward to your response. Please feel free to reach out if you need any additional information from me.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
