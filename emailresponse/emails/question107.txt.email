  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus. After carefully reading through the syllabus, I have a question regarding the online participation and decorum requirements.

In the section "Online Participation and Decorum," it is mentioned that "We reserve the right to deduct as much as 10% from a student's grade when their behavior does not follow the decorum requirements, with repeated or severe violations warranting larger-sized deductions." My question is, what constitutes a "repeated or severe violation" of the online participation and decorum requirements?

Will minor infractions, such as forgetting to authenticate as a UCI user or using the wrong tone in an email, result in a deduction? Or are there specific actions that will lead to a deduction?

I understand that you may not be able to provide a definitive answer to this question, but any clarification you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
