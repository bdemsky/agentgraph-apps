  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I am writing to ask some questions about the ICS 32A syllabus that I recently reviewed. I have read the syllabus carefully, but I want to make sure I understand some of the details.

1. Under "Attendance," it is stated that attendance does offer some significant benefits, including the opportunity to consult with a TA and LA regarding your work. How often are these staff available for consultation? Are they available during lab sessions only, or can I also reach out to them outside of lab?
2. In the "Academic honesty" section, it is mentioned that students who feel they may need an accommodation based on a disability should contact you privately to discuss their specific needs. What kinds of accommodations are available for students with disabilities in this course? Are there any specific resources or services that students can access?
3. Under "Grading," it is stated that the weights of graded artifacts are as follows: Projects (6%), Reinforcement exercises (16%), Final Exam (38%). How many points are available for each project, and how many reinforcement exercises are there in total?
4. In the "Online participation and decorum" section, it is mentioned that online participation is not measured, butdecorum requirements must be followed. What constitutes appropriate decorum in this course, and what are the consequences for not meeting these requirements?
5. In the "Determining final grades" section, it is stated that course grades will not be constrained by a straight scale or formalized curve. How will grades be determined, then? Will there be any additional factors taken into account besides the percentage of points earned?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing your responses.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
