Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read through the syllabus for the course and I found it to be quite comprehensive. I just had a question regarding the reinforcement exercises.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that the reinforcement exercises contribute to our grade, but it's not clear how they will be graded. Could you please provide some clarification on the grading criteria for the reinforcement exercises?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
