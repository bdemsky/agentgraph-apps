  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the ICS 32A syllabus for the upcoming quarter. I have read through the syllabus carefully, but I have a few questions that cannot be answered by reading the document closely.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more information on the pre-recorded videos that will be available throughout the quarter. How many videos are there in total, and what topics will they cover? Additionally, will these videos be available to watch at any time, or are there specific times when they will be released?

Secondly, I am curious about the in-person lab sessions that will be held throughout the week. How many lab sections are there in total, and what are the enrollment caps for each section? Also, will there be any opportunities for students to switch between lab sections if they need to?

Lastly, I noticed that the course requires no textbook, but it does mention that students may find a book that complements the lecture material and helps fill in details. Can you provide any recommendations on what kind of books students might find helpful for this course?

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
