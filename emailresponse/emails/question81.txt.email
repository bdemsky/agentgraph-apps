  Subject: Questions about ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on some points mentioned in the syllabus for ICS 45C, which I have accessed online. I would like to understand the expectations and requirements of the course more clearly.

1. In-person format: Can you elaborate on what you mean by "predominantly in-person format"? Will there be any online lectures or discussions?
2. Equipment requirements: Could you provide more details on the types of equipment needed for the course, such as a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam and microphone? Are there any specific brands or models recommended?
3. Pre-recorded videos: How will the pre-recorded videos be made available to students? Will they be linked through the Canvas course space?
4. Online participation: Can you elaborate on what you mean by "online decorum"? Are there any specific guidelines or rules that students should be aware of?
5. Reinforcement exercises: How will the reinforcement exercises be released? Will they be made available through the Canvas course space, or is there a specific schedule for when they will be released?
6. Lab meetings: Are there any specific times or locations for the in-person lab meetings? How can students attend these meetings?
7. Textbooks: Will there be any specific textbooks recommended for the course? Are there any online resources or supplements that students can use to complement the course material?
8. Accommodations: How can students request accommodations for disabilities? What is the process for requesting accommodations, and who should students contact?
9. Grading: Could you provide more details on the weightage of each assignment in the course? How will the final grade be determined?
10. Dropping or changing grade option: How can students drop or change their grade option in the course? What is the deadline for making these changes?

Thank you for your time and attention to my questions. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
