  Subject: Seeking Clarification on Course Organization and Expectations

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to request clarification on some of the details listed in the course syllabus for ICS 45C, specifically the sections related to in-person format, equipment requirements, and online participation.

Could you provide more information on what is meant by "predominantly in-person format"? Will there be any online components to the course, such as virtual lectures or discussions? How many hours per week can we expect to spend in-person for lectures and labs?

Additionally, I am curious about the equipment requirements. Will we need to purchase any specific hardware or software to keep up with the coursework? Are there any alternatives or recommendations for those who may not have access to the required equipment?

Regarding online participation, could you elaborate on what is expected of us in terms of decorum and etiquette? Are there any specific guidelines or resources available for maintaining a professional online presence?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the grading breakdown and weights for each assignment. How will the reinforcement exercises and programming projects be assessed, and what percentage of the overall grade will each component contribute?

Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing these questions. I look forward to a productive and successful academic year.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
