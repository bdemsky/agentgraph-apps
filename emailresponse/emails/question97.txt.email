  Subject: Questions about ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on some of the points mentioned in the syllabus for ICS 45C, which I have reviewed carefully.

Firstly, I would like to inquire about the format of the course. The syllabus mentions that the course will be administered in-person, but it does not specify whether there will be any online components to the course. Could you please provide more information on the course format and whether there will be any online meetings or assignments?

Secondly, I am curious about the pre-recorded videos that will be available for certain lectures. Will these videos be available on the Canvas course space, and how will they be graded? Are they mandatory to watch, or are they supplementary materials for reinforcement exercises?

Thirdly, I would like to know more about the lab meetings that will be held throughout the quarter. How often will these meetings be held, and what will be the agenda for these meetings? Will they be mandatory, or can I choose to attend at my convenience?

Lastly, I would like to request clarification on the policy regarding academic honesty. The syllabus mentions that all work must be completed solely by the student, and any violations of academic honesty policies will be reported to the UCI Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct. Could you please provide more details on what constitutes academic dishonesty and how to avoid it?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
