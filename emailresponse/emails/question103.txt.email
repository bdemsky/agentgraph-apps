  Subject: Questions about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask some questions about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. I have carefully read through the syllabus, but I would like some clarification on a few points.

Firstly, under the "Online decorum" section, it is mentioned that we are expected to meet the decorum requirements described above. Could you please elaborate on what constitutes acceptable behavior and decorum in the online spaces provided for the course?

Additionally, under the "Reinforcement exercises" section, it is mentioned that these exercises will be released as they are available. How will we know when new exercises are available, and will there be a specific deadline by which we must complete them?

Finally, under the "Grading" section, it is mentioned that the weights of graded artifacts will be determined from the weighted combination of our scores on each of six programming projects, eight sets of reinforcement exercises, and an in-person Final Exam. Could you please provide more information on what constitutes a "set-up" project, and how many points each project and exercise is worth?

Thank you for your time and assistance, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
