  Subject: Question about the course syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. My question is regarding the pre-recorded videos that will be available on YuJa. I was wondering if you could provide more information on what these videos will cover and how they will contribute to my understanding of the course material?

The syllabus mentions that there will be video content listed in the Schedule alongside the lecture material, but it does not provide any details on the specific topics that will be covered in these videos. As I am eager to make sure I am keeping up with the coursework, I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on this matter.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
