  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that I have reviewed. My question can be answered by closely reading the syllabus, and I would appreciate your clarification.

The question is: What is the definition of "pre-recorded videos" mentioned in the syllabus under the "Lecture" section? Are these videos available for officially-enrolled students to watch through any platform, or are they only available through Canvas?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
