Subject: Clarification on Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for the course and have found it to be quite comprehensive. However, there is one question that I have which I couldn't find the answer to in the syllabus.

Regarding the online participation and decorum policy, you mentioned that deductions may be made from a student's grade if their behavior does not follow the decorum requirements. While I understand the importance of maintaining a respectful and collegial environment, I was wondering if there are any specific examples or guidelines provided to help us better understand what behavior would be considered a violation of the decorum requirements.

I apologize if this question has already been addressed in the syllabus, but I couldn't find any specific details regarding what actions would be considered as violations. It would be helpful to have some guidance in order to ensure that I am abiding by the policies set forth.

Thank you for your time and clarification.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
