  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely. Specifically, I am interested in knowing the process for requesting accommodations for disabilities in the course.

Could you please provide information on how to contact the Disability Services Center and how to discuss specific needs related to a disability? I want to make sure that I am aware of the available resources and how to access them in case I need them.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
