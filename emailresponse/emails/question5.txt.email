Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have carefully read through the syllabus for our course, and I have a question regarding the attendance policy for the Final Exam.

In the syllabus, it states that attendance at the Final Exam is a required part of the course enrollment. I understand that the date and time of the exam are listed in the Schedule, and it is our responsibility to keep our schedule clear and arrive on time. However, I was wondering if there are any exceptions to this policy, specifically in cases of unforeseen circumstances such as illness or incapacitation.

Thank you for clarifying this matter. I appreciate your attention to my inquiry.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
