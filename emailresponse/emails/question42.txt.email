  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the course syllabus for ICS 46, as I have some questions that cannot be answered by reading the syllabus closely.

Specifically, I am interested in knowing if there are any specific requirements for the pre-recorded videos that will be available as part of the course. Will these videos be available for viewing at any time, or are there specific dates and times when they will be made available? Additionally, will these videos be graded in any way, or are they purely supplemental material?

I also have a question about the reinforcement exercises that are listed in the syllabus. How will these exercises be made available, and what is the format for completing and submitting them? Will they be available for viewing and completion throughout the quarter, or are there specific dates when they will be made available?

Finally, I am curious about the expectations for online participation and decorum. As the syllabus notes, there are specific requirements for online decorum, but it is not clear what these expectations entail. Can you provide more details on what is expected of students in terms of online behavior and participation?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
