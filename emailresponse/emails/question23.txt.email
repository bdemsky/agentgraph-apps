  Subject: Seeking Clarification on ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on the ICS 45C syllabus for the upcoming quarter. As a student enrolled in the course, I would like to better understand the following aspects of the syllabus:

1. In-person format: How often and for how long will the lectures be held in person? Are there any scheduled breaks during the lectures?
2. Equipment requirements: Could you provide more information on the types of equipment that are recommended or required for the course? Are there any specific software or hardware requirements?
3. Pre-recorded videos: How many pre-recorded videos are expected to be available for each lecture topic? Will these videos be available through Canvas or any other platform?
4. Online participation: Are there any specific online platforms or tools that are required for participation in the course? How will online decorum be monitored and enforced?
5. Accommodations for disabilities: How can students request accommodations for disabilities? What are the procedures for arranging alternative testing environments or note-taking services?
6. Grading policies: Could you provide more details on the weightage of each assignment, the final exam, and the online participation? Are there any deductions for repeated or severe violations of decorum?
7. Dropping or changing grade option: How can students drop or change their grade option during the quarter? Are there any deadlines or requirements for requesting these changes?
8. Academic honesty: Could you provide more information on the academic honesty policies of the Bren School of ICS and the University? What are the consequences of violating these policies?

Your clarification on these points will greatly assist me in preparing for the course. Please feel free to provide additional information or resources as needed. Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
