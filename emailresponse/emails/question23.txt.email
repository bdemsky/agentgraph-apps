Dear Professor,

I have read the syllabus for the ICS 45C course and have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises. In the syllabus, it mentions that there will be eight sets of reinforcement exercises throughout the course. However, it does not state when these exercises will be made available. Could you please clarify when these reinforcement exercises will be released?

Thank you,
