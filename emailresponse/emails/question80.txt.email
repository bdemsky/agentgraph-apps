  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few points regarding the ICS 32A syllabus for the upcoming quarter.

Firstly, I was wondering if you could provide more information on the pre-recorded videos that will be available for some lectures. How will these videos be made available, and will they be required viewing for the course?

Secondly, I am curious about the lab sections and their role in the course. What kind of computer equipment do I need to bring to the labs, and will attendance in these sections be mandatory?

Lastly, I want to inquire about the weightage of the different graded artifacts in the course. Can you provide a breakdown of the percentage weights for each of the programming projects, reinforcement exercises, and final exam?

I have read through the syllabus carefully, but I cannot find answers to these questions. Your help in clarifying these points would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
