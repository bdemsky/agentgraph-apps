  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As I go through the ICS 32A syllabus for the upcoming quarter, I have a few questions that arose from my reading:

1. Can you clarify the format of the in-person lectures? Are they held in a specific location, and are they recorded for students who cannot attend in person?
2. Are there any specific requirements for the laptop or desktop computer needed for the course? Are there any minimum system requirements, such as operating system or processor speed?
3. How will attendance be taken during the Final Exam? Will it be proctored in-person, or can students take the exam remotely?
4. Are there any resources available for students who may need accommodations due to disabilities? How can they be arranged, and what is the process for requesting them?
5. Can you provide more detail on the weights of the graded artifacts? Are there any specific requirements for the reinforcement exercises, such as submission deadlines or formatting guidelines?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
