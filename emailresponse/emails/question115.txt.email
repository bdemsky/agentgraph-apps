  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I have reviewed carefully. My question is related to the online participation and decorum section.

In the syllabus, it is mentioned that "While it is not our intent to measure your participation, we are requiring that students meet the decorum requirements described above. We reserve the right to deduct as much as 10% from a student's grade when their behavior does not follow those decorum requirements, with repeated or severe violations warranting larger-sized deductions."

My question is, what constitutes a violation of the online decorum requirements, and what are some examples of behavior that could result in a deduction in my grade? I want to make sure I am aware of these expectations and can maintain a positive and respectful online environment throughout the quarter.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
