  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I have a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that I hope you can help me with. I was reading through the syllabus and noticed that there is no information provided about the format of the exams. Will the exams be multiple choice, short answer, or essay-style questions? Additionally, will there be any visual aids or coding exercises that we need to complete during the exams?

I understand that you mentioned that the instructor and other course staff will hold live help sessions, but I want to make sure that I am fully prepared for the exams. Could you please provide some clarification on the exam format and what to expect?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
