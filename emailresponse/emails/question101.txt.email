  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that I have reviewed. I am eager to make sure I understand the course requirements and expectations before the quarter begins.

My question is regarding the requirement to watch pre-recorded videos as part of the course. The syllabus states that "Pre-recorded videos will be available on YuJa, which you'll find linked through the Canvas course space." It is not clear to me how I will be able to access these videos, as I do not have a YuJa account and am not sure if I need one to access the course materials. Could you please clarify how I can access the pre-recorded videos?

Additionally, I would like to know if there are any specific requirements for watching the videos, such as completing them within a certain timeframe or engaging in a certain level of participation. I want to ensure that I am fully prepared for the course and do not fall behind.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
