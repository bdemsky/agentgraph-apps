  Subject: Question about CompSci 161 Syllabus

Dear Professor Shindler,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a question about the CompSci 161 syllabus that I cannot seem to find an answer to by reading the document closely. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide some clarification.

In the section on "Getting help in this class," it is stated that "If your question is of general interest, or might be answerable by anyone in the class, post the question on EdStem with a privacy setting that allows your classmates to answer." However, it is not clear what kind of questions would be considered of general interest or how to determine the appropriate privacy setting for posting the question. Could you please provide some guidance on this matter?

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
