  Subject: Questions about the ICS 32A Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to ask some questions about the ICS 32A syllabus that was provided to us at the beginning of the quarter.

Firstly, I am curious about the pre-recorded videos that will be available for some lectures. Will these videos be available on YuJa, and how will I access them? Additionally, will these videos be available for all lectures, or will some be presented in-person only?

Secondly, I am unsure about the laptop requirement for the course. Do I need to bring a laptop to every lecture and lab session, or can I use a university-provided laptop? Also, are there any specific software or applications that I need to install on my laptop beforehand?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the reinforcement exercises and how they contribute to my overall grade. How many exercises are there in total, and how are they weighted in the grading criteria? Are there any specific guidelines or rubrics for completing these exercises?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
