  Subject: Question about the ICS 46 Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 46 syllabus that I cannot answer by reading the syllabus closely. In the "Online Decorum" section, it is mentioned that we are not allowed to ask questions on Ed Discussion about how our work was graded, how our work will be graded, or how others' work was graded. My question is, what if I have a specific question about the grading criteria or the grading process that is not covered in the Notes and Examples section of the syllabus? Will I still be able to ask that question on Ed Discussion, or will it be considered off-topic?

Thank you for your time and clarification.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
