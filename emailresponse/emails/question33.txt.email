Subject: Clarification regarding the syllabus for ICS 45C

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have read the syllabus for ICS 45C and have a question regarding the lab meetings. 

On the syllabus, it states that lab meetings will be offered on a selection of days and times throughout the week. I was wondering if there is a schedule available for these lab meetings, or if it will be announced at a later date. 

Thank you for your time and clarification. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
