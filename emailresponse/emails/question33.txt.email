  Subject: Questions about ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on certain points regarding the syllabus for ICS 45C, which I recently received. As I carefully read through the document, I realized that there are some aspects that I would like to inquire about.

Firstly, I am curious about the format of the course. The syllabus mentions that the course will be administered primarily in-person, but it does not provide details on the specific structure or schedule of the course. Could you please provide me with more information on the course format, including the dates and times of lectures, office hours, and any other important details?

Secondly, the syllabus mentions that pre-recorded videos will be available for some lectures. How will these videos be made available to us? Will they be posted on a specific platform, and if so, what is the link? Additionally, will there be any live sessions or Q&A sessions with the instructor or TAs?

Thirdly, the syllabus outlines the grading criteria for the course, but I am unsure about the weightage of each component. Could you please provide me with a breakdown of the weightage for each programming project, reinforcement exercises, and the final exam?

Lastly, I have a question regarding the academic honesty policy. As a student, I understand the importance of academic integrity and the consequences of violating it. However, I would like to know more about the plagiarism detection system used in the course. How does it work, and what are the consequences of plagiarism?

Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
