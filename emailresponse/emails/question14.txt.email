Subject: Clarification on Course Expectations

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I have thoroughly read through the syllabus for our course and I appreciate the detailed information provided. However, I still have one question regarding the course organization that I couldn't find an answer to in the syllabus.

Considering the predominantly in-person format of the course, I wanted to inquire about the flexibility for attending the ICS 32A Help Center. While I understand that attendance is not graded and it is not a required part of the course, I was wondering if attending the Help Center is available to students who are not officially enrolled in a lab section. Could you please clarify if students who are not enrolled in a lab section can still attend the Help Center for assistance from TAs and LAs?

Thank you in advance for your time and clarification. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
John Smith
