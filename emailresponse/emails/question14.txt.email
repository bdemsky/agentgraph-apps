  Subject: Question about the ICS 32A syllabus

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the ICS 32A syllabus that I cannot answer by reading the document closely.

In the section on attendance, it is stated that attendance does offer some significant benefits, such as the opportunity to consult with a TA and LA regarding your work. However, it is not specified how many TAs and LAs will be available for consultation. Could you provide information on the number of TAs and LAs available for consultation in the course?

Additionally, in the section on grading, it is mentioned that the weights of graded artifacts are as follows: projects (40%), reinforcement exercises (16%), and the final exam (38%). However, it is not clear what constitutes a "significant" violation of the decorum requirements that could result in a deduction of up to 10% from a student's grade. Could you provide more information on what types of behavior would be considered a significant violation of the decorum requirements?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
