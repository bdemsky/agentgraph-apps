Subject: Question about Course Syllabus

Dear Professor,

I have read the course syllabus for ICS 45C and I have a question regarding the reinforcement exercises. In the syllabus, it states that the exercises will be released as they are available. I was wondering if there is a specific schedule or deadline for completing these exercises? Will they be due on a weekly basis or at the end of the quarter? I want to make sure I stay on track with the course material.

Thank you for your clarification.

Best regards,
