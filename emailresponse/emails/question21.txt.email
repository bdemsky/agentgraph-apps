  Subject: Seeking Clarification on ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on certain aspects of the ICS 45C syllabus for the upcoming quarter. As I carefully read through the syllabus, I have some questions that I would like to discuss with you.

Firstly, I would like to inquire about the pre-recorded videos that will be available for certain lectures. Will these videos be available on YuJa, and how will they be linked to the Canvas course space? Additionally, will these videos be mandatory to watch, or are they meant for supplemental learning?

Secondly, I am curious about the online decorum expectations. As a student who values respectful communication and collaboration, I want to ensure that I am aware of the guidelines for online interactions. Could you provide more details on what constitutes offensive behavior and how it will be addressed?

Lastly, I would like to know more about the grading criteria for the programming projects and reinforcement exercises. What percentage of the total grade will each project and exercise account for, and how will the weights of these elements be determined?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
