  Subject: Questions about the ICS 45C Syllabus

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek your clarification on some aspects of the ICS 45C syllabus for the upcoming quarter. As I carefully read through the syllabus, I have a few questions that I would like to ask before the course begins.

Firstly, could you provide more information on the pre-recorded videos that will be available for some of the lectures? How will these videos be made available, and will they be mandatory to watch?

Secondly, I am curious about the online participation requirements and how they will be monitored. Will there be any specific online decorum rules that we are expected to follow, and what are the consequences if these rules are not followed?

Lastly, could you elaborate on the weights of the graded artifacts in the course? What percentage of the final grade will each component have, and how will the scores be combined?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
