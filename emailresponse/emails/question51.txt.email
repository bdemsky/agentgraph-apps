  Subject: Question about the Course Syllabus for ICS 46

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to ask a question about the course syllabus for ICS 46, which I recently received. My question can be answered by closely reading the syllabus, and I would greatly appreciate your clarification.

In the section "Online Decorum," it is mentioned that "While it is not our intent to measure your participation...we are requiring that students meet the decorum requirements described above. We reserve the right to deduct as much as 10% from a student's grade when their behavior does not follow those decorum requirements, with repeated or severe violations warranting larger-sized deductions."

My question is: What constitutes a "violation" of the online decorum requirements, and what are some examples of behavior that may result in a deduction in my grade?

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
