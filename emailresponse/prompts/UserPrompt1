From the email I provide below, determine the name of the course the student is inquiring about. Also, determine what the student is inquiring about.

Here is a list of courses I teach: 
{% for course in courses %}
    - {{ course }}
{% endfor %}

{% for course in courses %}
    If this email is related to my {{course}} course, please output the following and only the following: "CLASS*{{course}}"
{% endfor %}

Format your output like:
"CLASS*[course name]"

Only output a line like that and nothing else.

The course name should be in the list I provided, this is very important. 

For example, for the following email:

"
Hi Professor:

My name is Peter Anteater and I am in your ICS32A course. I unfortunately did not do as well as I had hoped on the Final, and I am now concerned about the grade I will receive in the course. I was just curious, how much does my grade on the final affect my overall course grade?

Thank you,
Peter Anteater
"

You would output only the following line in the format I specified. This is very important, do not output anything more than this line: 
"CLASS*ics32a" 

Notice you only output that one line and you ouput a course name that is in the list of courses I provided above. This is very important.


Here is the email from the student:
