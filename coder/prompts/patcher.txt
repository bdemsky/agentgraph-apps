Here is how the file `{{file_name}}` looks like right now:
```
{{old_contents}}
```

And here is the new implementation for the same file:
```
{{new_contents}}
```

Now, implement the new changes into the previously implemented file
and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that
are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation but
only combine those two.

**IMPORTANT**

All lines of code in the new implementation should be present.  Note
that there may be comments in the new implementation of the file that
indicates that parts of the original file be inserted where it is
indicated.

**IMPORTANT**

Make sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by
these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and
any other relevant logic that was in the original code.

Under no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code
snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists in the place
where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include
any code that is above or below the comment but only the code that
should be in the position of the comment.
