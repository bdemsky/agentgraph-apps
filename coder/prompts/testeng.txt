Provide a file named test.sh that should run the necessary unix
commands to run all the test cases.  If a test case fails, this script
should output on standard error which test case failed and details
about the test case and exit with a non zero exit code.  If all test
cases ran successfully, it should exit with a zero exit code.

For each failing test case, your test script should output:
1) The program output to standard output.
2) The program output to standard error.
3) The expected value

Note that you can capture both standard output and standard error to a
variable with the following bash command:

foo = $(./calculator "1+2" 2&>1)"

The script test.sh should also compile your code.  The script should
be placed in the current directory.  The test script should start with
basic tests and then move to more complex tests.

You will output the content of each file necessary to run the testing
script, including ALL code.  Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase file name including the
file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:
helloworld.sh
```
echo "Hello World"
```

Do not explain the code, just give the commands.

Do not use placeholders, use example values (like . for a folder
argument) if necessary.
