Here is the current code:

{{files}}

Please provide a script, compile.sh, that includes all the necessary unix
terminal commands to install dependencies and build the code.

You should assume the system already has the standard set of
development tools installed (compiler, interpreter, make, etc).

Do not install globally. Do not use sudo.

Do not explain the code, just give the commands.

Do not run the program you build in this script.

Do not use placeholders, use example values (like . for a folder
argument) if necessary.
