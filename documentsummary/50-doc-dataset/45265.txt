THIS is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at his savage whiskers, and his claws
and his turned-up tail.

THIS is a nice gentle Rabbit. His mother has given him a carrot.

[Illustration]

THE bad Rabbit would like some carrot.

HE doesn't say "Please." He takes it!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

AND he scratches the good Rabbit very badly.

THE good Rabbit creeps away, and hides in a hole. It feels sad.

[Illustration]

THIS is a man with a gun.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

HE sees something sitting on a bench. He thinks it is a very funny
bird!

[Illustration]

HE comes creeping up behind the trees.

AND then he shoots--BANG!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

THIS is what happens--

BUT this is all he finds on the bench, when he rushes up with his gun.

[Illustration]

THE good Rabbit peeps out of its hole,

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

AND it sees the bad Rabbit tearing past--without any tail or whiskers!
