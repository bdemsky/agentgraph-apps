                             THE FARMER MAN


                       Went Dolly and Molly,
                         one fine summer day,
                       To watch while the farmer
                         man made the new hay.

                      And a beautiful basket of
                        luncheon they took,
                      All wrapped in white napkins
                        by Mary the cook.

                             [Illustration]

                      He whetted his scythe.
                        Oh, the big noise it made!
                      And he cut down that hay,
                        each spear and each blade.

                             [Illustration]

                      The Grasshoppers hoppered,
                        and gazed in surprise.
                      You ought to have seen how
                        they stuck out their eyes!

                             [Illustration]

                       He took a big fork and he
                         spread, all around,
                       That sweet-smelling hay on
                         the sunshiny ground.

                  And the Hoppy Toads
                    blinked sadly, saying, “Oh, well,
                  We shall just have to move
                    to the Burdock Hotel.”

                             [Illustration]

                     Then he raked it in long
                       rows, and left it to dry,
                     While they all ate their lunch
                       ’neath a big tree near by.

                    And the Robin came too,
                      saying, “Please give me some,”
                    So Dolly and Molly each
                      gave him a crumb.

                             [Illustration]

                      Then the man tossed the hay
                        in a great shiny heap,
                      And put on its night cap,
                        and left it to sleep.

                             [Illustration]

                   Then a black and gold Bumblebee
                     bumbled along,
                   Saying, “It’s-time-little-girlies-
                     were-home-where-they-b’long.”

                             [Illustration]

                             [Illustration]

                     So Dolly and Molly, all tired
                       with play,
                     Just followed the Bumblebee
                       home all the way.

                             [Illustration]

                             [Illustration]

                      And Grandmother gave them
                        some milk and some bread,
                      And lovingly kissed them
                        and put them to bed.

                             [Illustration]

                      And the sleep fairies came
                        to that little white room,
                      And sprinkled them over
                        with sleep flower bloom.

                             [Illustration]

                             [Illustration]

                   And that was the end of
                     that beautiful day,
                   When the twins watched
                     the farmer man make the new hay.
