  Sure, here's a one-paragraph summary of "Aunt Affable's Story of Old Mother Bantry and Her Cat Grip":

Old Mother Bantry's mischievous cat Grip causes trouble when she goes out, eating food and catching a dwarf. When the dame returns home, she punishes Grip with a slap, but Grip continues to get into mischief in the house and even runs away. Eventually, Grip returns home on her own and the dame welcomes her back with open arms, promising to give her the run of the pantry and the choicest of mice to eat.
