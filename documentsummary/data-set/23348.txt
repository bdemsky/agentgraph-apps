            OLD MOTHER HUBBARD
               AND HER DOG.

              [Illustration]

          Old Mother Hubbard
          Went to the cupboard,
       To give her poor Dog a bone,
          When she came there
          The cupboard was bare,
       And so the poor Dog had none.

       For white wine and red,
          When she came back
       The Dog stood on his head.

          She brought him a cake
       Which she bought at the Fair,
          When she came back
       The Dog sat in a chair.

          To buy him a coffin,
       When she came back
          The Dog was laughing.

       She took a clean dish
          To get him some tripe,
       When she came back
          He was smoking his pipe.

          He was riding a goat.

       She went to the Hosier's
          To buy him some hose,

          He was drest in his clothes.

       The Dame made a curtsey,
          The Dog made a bow,
       The Dame said 'your servant,'
          The Dog said 'bow wow.'
