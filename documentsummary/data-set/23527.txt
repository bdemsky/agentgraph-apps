How to Make Mary and Her Lamb


Cut out the two double figures. Fold on the dotted lines marked A A A
A so that the upper part of each of the four figures projects forward
as shown in the small picture X. Fold on the lines marked B B where
the figures join each other so that the colored surfaces face outward,
and then, beginning at the feet, paste the front view of Mary to the
back view of the lamb as far as the dotted lines A A. In the same way
paste the front view of the lamb to the back view of Mary--as far up
as the lines A A. Now paste together the front and back of the upper
part of Mary. Then paste together the front and back of the upper part
of the lamb. Cut off the letters A A A A B B.

Now if the lamb is held by the feet and turned inside out, Mary will
appear, and _vice versa_. MAKE ALL THE OTHER CHANGELINGS IN PRECISELY
THE SAME WAY.

The Changelings will stand alone. If they do not stand firmly after
you have turned them, pinch them slightly along the dotted lines that
were marked A A A A.

    Look carefully at the finished Changeling in the front of
    the book. It will help you to make all the Magic Changelings
