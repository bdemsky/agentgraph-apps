Society's Child
(Janis Ian)

Come to my door, baby
Face is clean and shining black as night
My mama went to answer
You know that you looked so fine
Now I could understand the tears & the shame
She called you boy instead of your name
When she wouldn't let you inside
When she turned and said
"But honey, he's not our kind"

        She says I can't see you any more, baby
        Can't see you any more

Walk me down to school, baby
Everybody's acting deaf and blind
Until they turn and say
"Why don't you stick to your own kind"
My teachers all laugh, their smirking stares
Cutting deep down in our affairs
Preachers of equality
Think they believe it
Then why won't they just let us be?

        They say I can't see you any more, baby
        Can't see you any more

One of these days I'm gonna stop my listening
Gonna raise my head up high
One of these days I'm gonna raise up 
My glistening wings and fly
But that day will have to wait for a while
Baby, I'm only society's child
When we're older, things may change
But for now this is the way they must remain

        I say I can't see you any more, baby
        Can't see you any more
        No, I don't want to see you any more
        Baby
