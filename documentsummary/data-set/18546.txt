  Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall,
  Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall;
  All the king's horses, and all the king's men
  Cannot put Humpty-Dumpty together again.

  Old King Cole
    Was a merry old soul,
    And a merry old soul was he:

    He called for his pipe,
    And he called for his bowl,
  And he called for his fiddlers three.

    Every fiddler, he had a fiddle,
    And a very fine fiddle had he;
  Twee tweedle dee, tweedle dee, went the fiddlers.

    Oh, there's none so rare,
    As can compare
  With King Cole and his fiddlers three.

  Who lives in the lane.

  Mary had a little lamb,
  Its fleece was white as snow;
  And everywhere that Mary went,
  The lamb was sure to go.

  He followed, her to school one day;
  That was against the rule;
  It made the children laugh and play
  To see a lamb at school.

  And so the teacher turned him out,
  But still he lingered near,
  And waited patiently about
    Till Mary did appear.

  "What makes the lamb love Mary so?"
  The eager children cry.
  "Oh, Mary loves the lamb, you know."
    The teacher did reply.

  I had a little hobby-horse,
    And it was dapple grey;
  Its head was made of pea-straw,
    Its tail was made of hay.

    For a copper groat;
  And I'll not sing my song again
    Without a new coat.
