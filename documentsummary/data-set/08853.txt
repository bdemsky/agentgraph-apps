Book 65 Jude
001:001 Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James:
        To those who are in God the Father, enfolded in His love,
        and kept for Jesus Christ, and called.
001:002 May mercy, peace and love be abundantly granted to you.
001:003 Dear friends, since I am eager to begin a letter to you on
        the subject of our common salvation, I find myself constrained
        to write and cheer you on to the vigorous defense of the faith
        delivered once for all to God's people.
001:004 For certain persons have crept in unnoticed--men spoken of in ancient
        writings as pre-destined to this condemnation--ungodly men,
        who pervert the grace of our God into an excuse for immorality,
        and disown Jesus Christ, our only Sovereign and Lord.
001:005 I desire to remind you--although the whole matter is already
        familiar to you--that the Lord saved a people out of the land
        of Egypt, but afterwards destroyed those who had no faith.
001:006 And angels--those who did not keep the position originally
        assigned to them, but deserted their own proper abode--
        He reserves in everlasting bonds, in darkness, in preparation
        for the judgement of the great day.
001:007 So also Sodom and Gomorrah--and the neighboring towns
        in the same manner--having been guilty of gross fornication
        and having gone astray in pursuit of unnatural vice,
        are now before us as a specimen of the fire of the Ages
        in the punishment which they are undergoing.
001:008 Yet in just the same way these dreamers also pollute the body,
        while they set authority at naught and speak evil of dignities.
001:009 But Michael the Archangel, when contending with the Devil
        and arguing with him about the body of Moses, did not dare
        to pronounce judgement on him in abusive terms, but simply said,
        "The Lord rebuke you."
001:010 Yet these men are abusive in matters of which they know nothing,
        and in things which, like the brutes, they understand instinctively--
        in all these they corrupt themselves.
001:011 Alas for them; for they have followed in the steps of Cain;
        for the sake of gain they have rushed on headlong in the evil ways
        of Balaam; and have perished in rebellion like that of Korah!
001:012 These men--sunken rocks!--are those who share the pleasure
        of your love-feasts, unrestrained by fear while caring only
        for themselves; clouds without water, driven away by the winds;
        trees that cast their fruit, barren, doubly dead, uprooted;
001:013 wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars,
        for whom is reserved dense darkness of age-long duration.
001:014 It was also about these that Enoch, who belonged to the seventh
        generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, "The Lord has come,
        attended by myriads of His people, to execute judgement upon all,
001:015 and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly deeds
        which in their ungodliness they have committed, and of all
        the hard words which they, ungodly sinners as they are,
        have spoken against Him."
001:016 These men are murmurers, ever bemoaning their lot.
        Their lives are guided by their evil passions, and their mouths
        are full of big, boastful words, while they treat individual
        men with admiring reverence for the sake of the advantage
        they can gain.
001:017 But as for you, my dearly-loved friends, remember the words that
        before now were spoken by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ--
001:018 how they declared to you, "In the last times there shall
        be scoffers, obeying only their own ungodly passions."
001:019 These are those who cause divisions.  They are men of
        the world, wholly unspiritual.
001:020 But you, my dearly-loved friends, building yourselves up on
        the basis of your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,
001:021 must keep yourselves safe in the love of God, waiting for the
        mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ which will result in the Life
        of the Ages.
001:022 Some, when they argue with you, you must endeavor to convince;
001:023 others you must try to save, as brands plucked from the flames;
        and on others look with pity mingled with fear, while you
        hate every trace of their sin.
001:024 But to Him who is able to keep you safe from stumbling,
        and cause you to stand in the presence of His glory free
        from blemish and full of exultant joy--
001:025 to the only God our Saviour--through Jesus Christ our Lord,
        be ascribed glory, majesty, might, and authority, as it was
        before all time, is now, and shall be to all the Ages!  Amen.
