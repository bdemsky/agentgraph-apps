A FROG HE WOULD
A-WOOING GO

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

A Frog he would a-wooing go,
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
Whether his Mother would let him or no.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

So off he set with his opera-hat,
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
And on his way he met with a Rat.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

"Pray, MR. RAT, will you go with me,"
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"Pretty MISS MOUSEY for to see?"
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Now they soon arrived at Mousey's Hall,
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
And gave a loud knock, and gave a loud call.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

"Pray, Miss MOUSEY, are you within?"
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"Oh, yes, kind Sirs, I'm sitting to spin."
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

"Pray, Miss MOUSE, will you give us some beer?"
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer."
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho says_, ANTHONY ROWLEY!
[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

"Pray, Mr. FROG, will you give us a song?
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"But let it be something that's not very long."
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

"Indeed, Miss MOUSE," replied Mr FROG,
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"A cold has made me as hoarse as a Hog."
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

"Since you have caught cold," Miss MOUSEY said.
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
"I'll sing you a song that I have just made."
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

But while they were all thus a merry-making,
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
A Cat and her Kittens came tumbling in.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The Cat she seized the Rat by the crown;
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
The Kittens they pulled the little Mouse down.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

This put Mr. FROG in a terrible fright;
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
He took up his hat, and he wished them good night.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

But as Froggy was crossing a silvery brook,
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
A lily-white Duck came and gobbled him up.
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

So there was an end of one, two, and three,
                _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY!
The Rat, the Mouse, and the little Frog-gee!
            _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_,
                _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!
