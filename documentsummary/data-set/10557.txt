JOHNNY CROW'S PARTY

ANOTHER PICTURE BOOK

DRAWN BY

L. LESLIE BROOKE

First Edition, 1907


TO MY NEPHEW

SOMERSET

HAPPY IN A NAME THAT

ASSURES HIS WELCOME

TO JOHNNY CROW'S--OR

ANY OTHER--PARTY



Johnny Crow
Plied Rake and Hoe

And improved his little Garden.

And the Eagle

Looked quite regal

In Johnny Crow's Garden

And the Cockatoo
Said "_Comment vous portez vous?_"

And the Gander

Didn't understand her;

But the Flamingo
Talked the same lingo

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

And the Bear

Sang a sentimental Air,

But the Giraffe
Was inclined to laugh;

Even the Duckling
Couldn't help chuckling
In Johnny Crow's Garden.

Then the Snake

Got entangled with the rake

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

And the Cock

Had a very nasty knock;

So the Hen
Said:

"We'll never come again

To Johnny Crow's Garden!"

And the Sheep

Went to sleep,

And the Armadillo

Used him for a pillow;

And the Porcupine

Said: "Wake me if for talk you pine!"

In Johnny Crow's

Garden.

And the Kangaroo

Tried to paint the Roses blue

Till the Camel
Swallowed the Enamel.

And the Reindeer
Said: "I'm sorry for your pain, dear!"

In Johnny Crow's Garden.

So the Chimpanzee
Put the Kettle on for Tea;

And the Seal

Made a very big Meal;

While the Sole
Shared a Muffin with the Mole
In Johnny Crow's Garden.

Then they picked the Flowers, and
Wandered in the Maze,
And before they went their several ways

They all joined together
In a Hearty Vote of Praise

Of Johnny Crow and his
Garden.
