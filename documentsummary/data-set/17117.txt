                   An Elegy

            on the Glory of Her Sex

               MRS. MARY BLAIZE


                      by

             Dr. Oliver Goldsmith

[Illustration (drawing, pic04trans.gif)]

Good people all,
  with one accord,
Lament for
  Madam Blaize,
Who never wanted
  a good word--


[Illustration (drawing, pic05trans.gif)]

_From those_


[Illustration (drawing, pic06trans.gif)]

  _who spoke her praise._




[Illustration (painting, pic07.jpg)]




[Illustration (drawing, pic08trans.gif)]

The needy seldom pass'd her door,
  And always found her kind;
She freely lent to all the poor--


[Illustration (drawing, pic09trans.gif)]

_Who left_


[Illustration (drawing, pic10trans.gif)]

  _a pledge behind._




[Illustration (painting, pic11.jpg)]




[Illustration (drawing, pic12trans.gif)]

She strove the neighbourhood to please
  With manners wondrous winning;


[Illustration (drawing, pic13trans.gif)]

And never follow'd wicked ways--


[Illustration (drawing, pic14trans.gif)]

  _Unless when she was sinning._




[Illustration (drawing, pic15trans.gif)]

At church, in silks and satins new,
  With hoop of monstrous size,
She never slumber'd in her pew--


[Illustration (painting, pic16.jpg)]


[Illustration (drawing, pic17trans.gif)]

  _But when she shut her eyes._




[Illustration (drawing, pic18trans.gif)]




[Illustration (drawing, pic19trans.gif)]

Her love was sought, I do aver,
  By twenty beaux and more;
The King himself has follow'd her--


[Illustration (painting, pic20.jpg)]


[Illustration (drawing, pic21trans.gif)]

  _When she has walk'd before._




[Illustration (drawing, pic22trans.gif)]




But now, her wealth and finery fled,
  Her hangers-on cut short-all:
The Doctors found, when she was dead
  _Her last disorder mortal._

[Illustration (drawing, pic23trans.gif)]

Let us lament, in sorrow sore,
  For Kent Street well may say,
That had she lived a twelvemonth more,--
  _She had not died to-day._
