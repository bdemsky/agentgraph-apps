                            NAUGHTY PUPPIES




                          THE NAUGHTY PUPPIES


          _Tiny and his Parents._

    There were two little puppy dogs,
      "Tiny" named, and "Toodles,"
    Who got into all kinds of scrapes,
      Like little foolish noodles.

    Tiny was a brownish dog,
      And Toodles was a white one;
    And Tiny had a cunning eye,
      And Toodles had a bright one.

    Tiny played all kinds of tricks.
      For which his parents chid him:
    And Toodles did--poor, foolish pup--
      Whatever Tiny bid him.

      _Tiny, Toodles, and the Turkey._

    "Come, Toodles," Tiny said, one day,
      "It's bright and pleasant weather,
    We'll go and fight the turkey-cock:"
      And off they went together.

    But all their courage oozed away,
      When the turkey-cock said "Gobble;"
    They both turned tail, and scampered off,
      As fast as they could toddle.

    But turkey caught them up at last,
      And read them both a lecture;
    And how he served them with his beak,
      I leave you to conjecture.

    So home they went with drooping tails,
      And pace so lame and jerky,
    And said, "Next time we'll tease the hens,
      And leave alone the turkey."

  _New Mischief done by the Puppies._

    The visits to the poultry-yard,
      Of Tiny and of Toodles,
    Soon brought on their papa a call
      Of Master Cockadoodle's.

    He said, "My hens can't lay an egg,
      Though once I had a case full;
    Because your puppies frighten them--
      It's wicked, it's disgraceful!

    "But let them venture once again,
      My hens to chase and worry,
    And I'll receive them in a way
      Shall make them sad and sorry."

    Toodles heard this, and crept away,
      And in the straw lay quiet;
    But Tiny yelled till the cock marched off,
      Disgusted with the riot.


    _Tiny and Toodles behave worse than ever._

    From bad to worse went these naughty pups--
      It's almost past believing,
    But yet, I assure you, 'tis a fact,
      That now they took to thieving.

    They soon fell into bad company;
      And certain unprincipled poodles,
    And idle mongrels, and bob-tailed curs,
      Were the consorts of Tiny and Toodles.

    They let these bad dogs into the house,
      Where a pot of milk was standing;
    In quest of which they scampered upstairs,
      As far as the first-floor landing.

    But Betty, the cook, was scrubbing the stairs,
      With a mop and a pail of water;
    And Tiny ran off, with his head in the pot,
      While the rest yelled out for quarter.

_How Tiny hunted the Cat, and what he got by it._

    Now little Miss Jane had a Persian cat.
      Whose fur was soft and silky;
    Whose tail was long, and whose eyes were blue,
      And whose color was white and milky.

    This was a quiet, good-natured cat.
      And Master Tiny knew it;
    He said, "I'll frighten her out of her wits:
      Just watch me, Toodles--I'll do it."

    So he ran at Puss, with a yelp and a snap,
      As fast as he was able;
    Across the paddock, and through the yard,
      And over the fence by the stable.

    But Puss turned suddenly, scratched his nose,
      And set him yelling and weeping;
    And Tiny owned, with a rueful face,
      That he wished he'd left her sleeping.

      _What happened to Tiny and Toodles._

    Punishment follows folks who play tricks,
      Although they hope to keep clear of it:
    The puppies' bad conduct was told papa,
      Who was mightily grieved to hear of it.

    For papa was a grave, respectable dog,
      Faithful, and full of affection;
    And the farmyard was safe from robbers by night,
      Under his steady protection.

    So he said: "To cure you of pranks like these,
      I condemn each little sinner,
    To stand and look on for three whole days,
      While I eat up his dinner.

    "And to show you I mean to mend your ways,
      By every means in my power,
    You shall both learn, 'How doth the busy bee
      Improve each shining hour.'"
