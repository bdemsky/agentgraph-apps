Book 63        2 John

63:001:001 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
           the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known
           the truth;

63:001:002 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
           us for ever.

63:001:003 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and
           from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth
           and love.

63:001:004 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
           truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.

63:001:005 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
           commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
           beginning, that we love one another.

63:001:006 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is
           the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
           should walk in it.

63:001:007 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
           that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and
           an antichrist.

63:001:008 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we
           have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

63:001:009 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
           Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
           Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

63:001:010 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
           receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:

63:001:011 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
           deeds.

63:001:012 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
           paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to
           face, that our joy may be full.

63:001:013 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
