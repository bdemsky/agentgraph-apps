LITTLE SARAH






[Illustration: Front Cover]





[Illustration]

Little Sarah she stood by her grandmother's bed,
"And what shall I get for your breakfast?" she said;
"You shall get me a Johnny-cake: quickly go make it,
In one minute mix, and in two minutes bake it."

So Sarah she went to the closet to see
If yet any meal in the barrel might be.
The barrel had long time been empty as wind;
Not a speck of the bright yellow meal could she find.

[Illustration]

But grandmother's Johnny-cake--still she must make it,
In one minute mix, and in two minutes bake it.

She ran to the shop; but the shopkeeper said,
"I have none--you must go to the miller, fair maid;
For he has a mill, and he'll put the corn in it,
And grind you some nice yellow meal in a minute;
But run, or the Johnny-cake, how will you make it,
In one minute mix, and in two minutes bake it?"

[Illustration]

Then Sarah she ran every step of the way;
But the miller said, "No, I have no meal to-day;
Run, quick, to the cornfield, just over the hill,
And if any be there, you may fetch it to mill.
Run, run, or the Johnny-cake, how will you make it,
In one minute mix, and in two minutes bake it?"

[Illustration]

She ran to the cornfield--the corn had not grown,
Though the sun in the blue sky all pleasantly shone.
"Pretty sun," cried the maiden, "please make the corn grow."
"Pretty maid," the sun answered, "I cannot do so."

[Illustration]

"Then grandmother's Johnny-cake--how shall I make it,
In one minute mix, and in two minutes bake it?"

Then Sarah looked round, and she saw what was wanted;
The corn could not grow, for no corn had been planted.

[Illustration]

She asked of the farmer to sow her some grain,
But the farmer he laughed till his sides ached again.
"Ho! ho! for the Johnny-cake--how can you make it,
In one minute mix, and in two minutes bake it?"

The farmer he laughed, and he laughed out aloud,--
"And how can I plant till the earth has been ploughed?
Run, run to the ploughman, and bring him with speed;
He'll plough up the ground, and I'll fill it with seed."

[Illustration]

Away, then, ran Sarah, still hoping to make it,
In one minute mix, and in two minutes bake it.

[Illustration]

The ploughman he ploughed, and the grain it was sown,
And the sun shed his rays till the corn was all grown;
It was ground at the mill, and again in her bed
These words to poor Sarah the grandmother said:
"You shall get me a Johnny-cake--quickly go make it,
In one minute mix, and in two minutes bake it."
