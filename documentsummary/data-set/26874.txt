  The Lord is my rock
  and my fortress.  2 Sam. XXII 2.


  Rock of ages cleft for me,
  Let me hide myself in Thee;

[Illustration: Page 1]

  Let the water and blood,
  From thy riven side which flow'd,

[Illustration: Page 2]

  Be of sin the double cure,
  Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

[Illustration: Page 3]

[Illustration: Ocean waves]

  Not the labors of my hands
  Can fulfil Thy laws demands;

[Illustration: Page 5]

[Illustration: Birds]

  Could my zeal no respite know,
  Could my tears for ever flow,

[Illustration: Page 7]

[Illustration: Angel]

  All for sin could not atone,
  Thou must save, and Thou alone,

[Illustration: Page 9]

  Nothing in my hand I bring,
  Simply to thy cross I cling;

[Illustration: Page 10]

[Illustration: Flowers]

  Naked, come to Thee for dress;
  Helpless look to Thee for grace;

[Illustration: Page 12]

[Illustration: Angel]

  Foul, I to the fountain fly;
  Wash me, Savior, or I die.

[Illustration: Page 14]

[Illustration: Flowers]

  While I draw this fleeting breath,
  When my eyelids close in death,
  When I soar thro' tracts unknown,

[Illustration: Page 16]

[Illustration: Angel]

  See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
  Rock of ages, cleft for me,
  Let me hide myself in thee.
