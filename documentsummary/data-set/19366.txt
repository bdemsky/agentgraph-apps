  Punky Dunk on a day in the middle of May
  Looked around like a wise little cat,
  And he said with surprise: "Can I trust my own eyes?
  Well, what do you know about that?"

  [Illustration]

  For a wagon of blue, with a man in blue, too,
  At the sidewalk was just backing up.
  And the man brought a crate that was heavy of weight
  And inside was a gay spotted pup.

  [Illustration]

  Now Punky felt hurt as he gazed very pert
  At the gay spotted pup in the box,
  For the pup was all white, save for spots black as night
  On his back and his tail, ears and sox.

  [Illustration]

  "Meow!" said the cat, "That pup is too fat
  To run or to climb up a tree.
  The baby won't like that gay spotted tike
  As well as I know he likes me."

  [Illustration]

  Punky said: "He may run, but he won't be much fun,
  He may set, or may bark, or may point."
  You see, Punky's heart was beginning to smart
  And his nose was put clear out of joint.

  [Illustration]

  The pup was let out, and he ran all about
  So happy was he to be free.
  Then Punky said: "Meow!" the dog said: "Bow-wow!"
  And Punky said: "Look out for me!"

  [Illustration]

  He raised up his hair and tried hard to scare
  The pup, so he would run away,
  But the pup shook his head and in dog talk he said:
  "No, Punky, I've come here to stay."

  [Illustration]

  Then Punky, quite rash, at the pup made a dash,
  But the pup stood his ground very bold.
  And Punky then stopped so quick that he dropped
  And over and over he rolled.

  [Illustration]

  Then the pup with a bark started in for a lark
  But Punky thought he meant to fight,
  And he ran up a tree just as fast as could be
  And he stayed there until it was night.

  [Illustration]

  Punky Dunk has made up with the gay spotted pup
  And with Baby they play every day.
  Don't you think, little friends, that this little tale ends
  In the very best kind of way?
