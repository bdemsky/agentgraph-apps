JACKY DANDY.

[Illustration]

    This is little Jacky Dandy
    He loves cake and sugar-candy,
    He bought some at the grocer's shop,
    And pleased away went hop, hop, hop.


    He hopp'd to the fair,
    And saw a show there.

[Illustration]

    The first was the Lion,
    That never would yield;
    Behold how he ranger,
    The King of the field.


He next saw the Wolf, a cruel and savage beast.

[Illustration]

    This is the Wolf,
      That prouls thro' the wood,
    Who preys upon lambs,
      And drinks of their blood.


He was next shewn a Monkey, a funny fellow, but mischievous.

[Illustration]

    The monkey mischievous
    Like a naughty boy looks,
    Who plagues all his friends,
    And don't mind his books.


The next was a Bear, that had been taught to dance.

[Illustration]

    This is the Bear,
      In Greenland was bred,
    And brought over here,
      Thro' the streets to be led.


The next was the Tiger.

[Illustration]

      The savage Tiger will, they say,
    Sieze any man that's in his way,
    And o'er his back the victim throw,
    As you your satchel may do now.


He now saw a little Robin Red-breast hopping about.

[Illustration]

    He cocks his tail,
      While hopping along,
    And pays for his crumbs
      With an innocent song.


The next was little Jenny Wren the smallest bird in England.

[Illustration]

    The little Robin
      And the Wren,
    Are Jacky Dandy's
       Cock and Hren.


The next was a Kite a cruel enemy to all small birds.

[Illustration]

    This is the Kite,
    When searching for food
    Kills Bob and his wife,
    And all the young brood.


The next was a Goose, some say a silly bird but good roasted.

[Illustration]

    This is the Goose,
    That wadles and swims,
    See, little boy,
    How foolish she seems.


The next was a beautiful Game Cock with fine comb and gills.

[Illustration]

    This is the Cock
    Who crows, if you're wise,
    To tell you from bed
    'Tis time for to rise.


The next was a Hen and Chickens--See, there is one on her Back.

[Illustration]

    This is the Hen
    Who cares for her young,
    And cackles to please them
    Instead of a song.


The next was a very fine Newfoundland Dog.

[Illustration]

    This is the Dog,
    Who whilst we're asleep,
    Is a guard to the house,
    And from thieves does it keep.


The next was a nice Cat who sat purring a song.

[Illustration]

    This is poor Puss,
    The beautiful Cat,
    That keeps the house clear,
    Of both Mouse and Rat.




CONCLUSION.


[Illustration]

    Now you've all the Beast
    And the Birds that are handy,
    Take this horse and ride home
    With little Jack Dandy.
