_London  FREDERICK WARNE & CO. LTD.  New York_




"Three Blind Mice." Round (or Canon) for Three Voices.

  [Music:

  _Moderately Quick._

  Three blind mice,
  Three blind mice,
  Three blind mice,

  See how they run!
  See how they run!
  See how they run!

  They all ran after the farmer's wife,
  who cut off their tails with a carving knife,
  Did you ever see such a sight in your life

  As three blind mice?

  _Twice through and finish at pause._]

  of ye
  THREE BLIND MICE

  Three Small Mice

  Three Small Mice

  Pined for some fun
  Pined for some fun
  Pined for some fun

  They made up their minds to set out to roam;
  Said they, "'Tis dull to remain at home,"
  And all the luggage they took was a comb,
    These three Small Mice


  Three Bold Mice
  Three Bold Mice

  Came to an Inn
  Came to an Inn
  Came to an Inn

  "Good evening, Host, can you give us a bed?"
  But the Host he grinned and he shook his head;

  [Illustration]

  So they all slept out in a field instead,
    These three Bold Mice.

  [Illustration]


  [Illustration]

  Three Cold Mice
  Three Cold Mice

  Woke up next morn

  Woke up next morn

  They each had a cold and a swollen face,
  Through sleeping all night in an open space;
  So they rose quite early and left the place,
    These three Cold Mice.

  [Illustration]


  [Illustration]

  Three Hungry Mice
  Three Hungry Mice

  Searched for some food
  Searched for some food
  Searched for some food

  But all they found was a walnut shell
  That lay by the side of a dried-up well;
  Who had eaten the nut they could not tell,
    These three Hungry Mice.


  [Illustration]

  Three Starved Mice
  Three Starved Mice

  Came to a Farm
  Came to a Farm
  Came to a Farm

  The Farmer was eating some bread and cheese;
  So they all went down on their hands and knees,
  And squeaked, "Pray, give us a morsel, please,"
    These three Starved Mice.

  [Illustration]


  [Illustration]

  Three Glad Mice
  Three Glad Mice

  Ate all they could
  Ate all they could
  Ate all they could

  They felt so happy they danced with glee;
  But the Farmer's Wife came in to see
  What might this merry-making be
    Of three Glad Mice.

  [Illustration]


  [Illustration]

  Three Poor Mice

  Soon changed their tone
  Soon changed their tone
  Soon changed their tone

  The Farmer's Wife said, "What are you at,
  And why were you capering round like that?
  Just wait a minute: I'll fetch the Cat"
    Oh dear! Poor Mice.

  [Illustration]


  [Illustration]

  Three Scared Mice
  Three Scared Mice

  Ran for their lives
  Ran for their lives
  Ran for their lives

  They jumped out on to the window ledge;
  The mention of "Cat" set their teeth on edge;
  So they hid themselves in the bramble hedge,
    These three Scared Mice.


  [Illustration]

  Three Sad Mice
  Three Sad Mice

  What could they do?
  What could they do?
  What could they do?

  The bramble hedge was most unkind:
  It scratched their eyes and made them blind,
  And soon each Mouse went out of his mind,
    These three Sad Mice.

  [Illustration]


  [Illustration]

  Three Blind Mice
  Three Blind Mice

  See how they run
  See how they run
  See how they run

  They all ran after the Farmer's Wife,
  Who cut off their tails with the carving knife.
  Did you ever see such a sight in your life
    As three Blind Mice?

  [Illustration:
  "This smells like a Chemist's"]

  Three Sick Mice
  Three Sick Mice

  Gave way to tears
  Gave way to tears
  Gave way to tears

  They could not see and they had no end;
  They sought a Chemist and found a Friend
  He gave them some "Never too late to mend,"
    These Three Sick Mice.

  [Illustration]


  [Illustration]

  Three Wise Mice
  Three Wise Mice

  Rubbed rubbed away
  Rubbed rubbed away
  Rubbed rubbed away

  And soon their tails began to grow,
  And their eyes recovered their sight, you know;
  They looked in the glass and it told them so.
    These three Wise Mice.

  Three Proud Mice

  Soon settled down

  The name of their house I cannot tell,
  But they've learnt a trade and are doing well.
  If you call upon them, ring the bell
    Three times twice.
