A FARMER WENT TROTTING
      UPON HIS GREY MARE


[Illustration]


    A Farmer went trotting upon his grey Mare,
            Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    With his Daughter behind him, so rosy and fair;
            Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

    A  Raven cried "Croak!" and they all tumbled down;
            Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    The Mare broke her knees and the Farmer his crown;
            Lumpety lumpety, lump!

    The mischievous Raven flew laughing away;
            Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    And vowed he would serve them the same the next day;
            Lumpety, lumpety, lump!
