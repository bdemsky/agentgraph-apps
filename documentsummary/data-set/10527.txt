On the Banks of the Ohio
(Traditional)

I asked my love to take a walk,
Just to walk a little way.
And we did walk,
And we did talk,
All about our wedding day.

Chorus:
"Then only, say that you'll be mine;
And in no other's arms entwine,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio."

I took her by her lilly white hand,
I led her down the banks of sand,
I plunged her in
Where she would drown,
And watched her as she floated down.

Chorus

Returnin' home between twelve and one,
Thinkin', Lord, what have I done;
I'd killed the girl
I love, you see,
Because she would not marry me.
