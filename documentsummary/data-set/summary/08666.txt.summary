  In 1936, the Social Security Administration established a social security account for eligible employees, providing monthly checks to retired workers aged 65 and older, based on their past wages. The amount of the check depends on the individual's earnings history, with the maximum being $85 a month. If the individual dies before age 65, their family receives a payment in cash equal to 3Â½ cents on every dollar of wages earned after 1936. The law also established new taxes to fund the program, which are collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
