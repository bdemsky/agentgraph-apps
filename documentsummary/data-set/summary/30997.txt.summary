  A new subspecies of bat, Leptonycteris nivalis longala, is described from Coahuila, Mexico, based on its larger skull and longer third finger compared to other bats of the same species found in southern Mexico and Texas. The subspecies inhabits the northeastern end of the Mexican Plateau and is larger in size than other specimens from southern Coahuila.
