  The poem "A Velha Disciplina" by J. Dumont is a scathing critique of a tyrannical matron who uses discipline and punishment to maintain control over others. The speaker argues that this approach is unjust and devoid of compassion, and that true power comes from empathy and understanding. The poem also touches on themes of freedom, equality, and the importance of standing up against oppressive authority.
