  In the story, a psychiatrist named Maxwell Hanstark visits a housewife named Mrs. Nest to assess her husband's bizarre behavior, which includes staring at the grass in their backyard and insisting he is standing on top of a cliff. Mrs. Nest reveals that her husband's behavior started after she let him stay up late watching old cowboy movies during "Texas Week." Hanstark suspects that the husband may be experiencing a psychotic episode and asks Mrs. Nest to show him where her husband is. As Hanstark approaches the backyard, Mrs. Nest warns him to be careful and stays inside.
