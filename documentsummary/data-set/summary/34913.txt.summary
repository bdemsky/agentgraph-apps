  The document is a theological treatise that explores the nature of God and the Trinity, refuting heresies and defending the orthodox view. It cites various biblical passages and patristic writings to establish the divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The editor notes that some fragments from St. Hilary's letters to St. Augustine are included, but these should be omitted from the edition due to their lack of relevance to the main argument.
