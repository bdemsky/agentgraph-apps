The poem "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow depicts the struggle between despair and hope during Christmas. The speaker initially despairs at the lack of peace in the world, but the bells' message of God's presence and eventual triumph brings hope and reaffirms the importance of peace and goodwill.
