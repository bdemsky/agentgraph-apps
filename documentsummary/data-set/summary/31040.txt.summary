  Researchers at the University of Kansas' Museum of Natural History have studied the distribution and systematic position of the pigmy woodrat, _Neotoma goldmani_, in the Mexican Plateau. They have found that it is more closely related to _Neotoma albigula_ than to _Neotoma lepida_, and have identified distinct differences in cranial features between the species.
