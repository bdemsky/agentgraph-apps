  The document is a biblical passage from the Book of Jonah, where the prophet is instructed by God to go to Nineveh and warn the people of their impending doom due to their wickedness. Jonah reluctantly obeys and enters the city, where he preaches a single day, and the people repent, leading to their salvation.
