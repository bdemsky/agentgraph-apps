  Sure! Here is a 50-word summary of the document:

A mischievous monkey named Jacko is pulled from a tree by a lion and lioness who want to fatten him for dinner. Jacko tricks them by only eating one banana a day and giving the rest to rats, who suggest he wants a cocoa-nut. The lions steal cocoa-nuts but can't reach them, so they threaten the rats, who gnaw them off the tree. Jacko gets the cocoa-nuts and eats them, but they are hard to crack, so he makes a warm coat from the husk.
