  In this children's story, Jesus takes his friends on a walk and tells them he will soon go up to heaven. He promises to send the Holy Spirit to be with them. Jesus then ascends into heaven, and his friends are comforted by two angels who tell them Jesus will return in the same way he left. The story ends with a reminder to pray to Jesus and to love him, as his return is unknowable.
