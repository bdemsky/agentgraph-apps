  In this science fiction story, Mars and Earth are about to make contact for the first time in centuries. Mars has much to offer Earth, including advanced parapsychological sciences, but Earth has something to offer in return: science and technology to help restore Mars' dying planet. However, the connection is one-way, and Mars cannot communicate with Earth directly, so they must wait for Earth's next rocket to land and make contact.
