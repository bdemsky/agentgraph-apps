  The book of Haggai is a prophetic message from God to the people of Judah, encouraging them to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem, which had been left unfinished for many years. Despite their initial reluctance and lack of resources, the people are urged to work on the temple and trust in God's promise of blessings and glory.
