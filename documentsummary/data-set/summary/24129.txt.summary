  In 1910, a document titled "MONÃ“LOGO DO VAQUEIRO" by Gil Vicente was published. The monologue describes a vaqueiro's (cowherd) thoughts and feelings upon entering the palace to visit the queen. The vaqueiro marvels at the beauty of the palace and the queen's glory, but also expresses his own longing and desire for happiness. The document is significant as it showcases the author's use of language and the development of the Portuguese language.
