  In this paper, Dalquest and Hall describe a new species of bat (Myotis argentatus) found in Mexico. The bat is differentiated from other species in the genus by its medium size, short tail, black ears and membranes, and white-tipped fur on its hindquarters. The authors also note differences in skull structure and tooth size compared to other species.
