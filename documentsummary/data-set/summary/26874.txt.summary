  "Rock of Ages" is a hymn written by A. M. Toplady, a 19th-century British poet and Anglican clergyman. The poem reflects on the Christian concept of God as a rock of refuge and salvation, drawing on biblical imagery and themes of sin, redemption, and faith. The poem's 16 stanzas express a deep trust in God's grace and mercy, with the speaker seeking refuge in Him and finding comfort in His love.
