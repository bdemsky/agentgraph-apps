  In this document, researchers E. Raymond Hall and Walter W. Dalquest describe a new species of doglike carnivore, Cynarctus fortidens, from the Clarendonian Pliocene of Texas. The species is differentiated from other related species by the absence of an accessory cusp between the protocone and paracone of the fourth upper premolar, and the lack of a cingulum on the part of the fourth upper premolar that is internal to the protocone. The researchers suggest that the genus Cynarctus belongs to the family Canidae rather than the family Procyonidae.
