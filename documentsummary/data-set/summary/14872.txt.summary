  In "The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin," a group of squirrels, led by Nutkin, visit Old Brown, an owl who lives on an island in a lake. Nutkin is impertinent and disruptive, while his brother Twinkleberry is polite and respectful. The squirrels gather nuts and other gifts for Old Brown, but Nutkin fails to bring a present on the third day. The story ends with Old Brown refusing to share his nuts with Nutkin.
