THE MAN IN THE MOON.


          The Man in the Moon
            Came tumbling down,
          And asked his way to Norwich;

[Illustration]

            They told him south,
            And he burnt his mouth
          With eating cold pease-porridge.

TO MARKET, TO MARKET.


          To market, to market, to buy a fat Pig;
          Home again, home again, dancing a jig.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          To market, to market, to buy a fat Hog;
            Home again, home again, jiggety-jog.

THERE WAS A MAN.


          There was a man, and he had nought,
            And robbers came to rob him;

[Illustration]

          He crept up to the chimney-pot,

[Illustration: AND THEN THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD HIM]

[Illustration: BUT HE GOT DOWN ON T'OTHER SIDE]

[Illustration]

          And then they could not find him;

[Illustration]

          He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,
            And never looked behind him.

THE LION AND THE UNICORN.


          The Lion and the Unicorn
            Were fighting for the Crown;
          The Lion beat the Unicorn
            All round about the town.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          Some gave them white bread,
            And some gave them brown;
          Some gave them plum-cake,
            And sent them out of town.

LITTLE MISS MUFFET.


[Illustration]

          Little Miss Muffet
            Sat on a tuffet
          Eating of curds and whey;

[Illustration]

            There came a big Spider
            And sat down beside her,
          And frightened Miss Muffet away.

GOOSEY, GOOSEY GANDER.


          Goosey, Goosey Gander,
          Where shall I wander?

[Illustration]

          Upstairs, downstairs,
          And in my lady's chamber.

[Illustration]

          There I met an old man
            That would not say his prayers:
          I took him by the left leg,
            And threw him downstairs.

          Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall;

[Illustration]

          All the King's horses and all the King's men
          Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again.

BAA, BAA, BLACK SHEEP.

          Baa, baa, Black Sheep,
            Have you any wool?
          Yes, marry, have I,
            Three bags full:

[Illustration]

          One for my Master,
            And one for my Dame,
          And one for the little boy
            That lives in the lane!

THE THREE WISE MEN OF GOTHAM.

          Three wise men of Gotham
            Went to sea in a bowl:

          If the bowl had been stronger,
            My song would have been longer.
