_Portion of review from "American Architect," page 16, issue of July 8,
1908._

"Probably the most interesting moments of the trip abroad by the
architectural students are those spent in sketching bits of interest in
water color. And it is equally true, we believe, that nothing is so
helpful, so reminiscent as these same notes of color when viewed in
alter years.

We have been prompted to these remarks by the receipt of five portfolios
of color plates, being copies of original water color drawings by
English and French water colorists."
