Book 37        Haggai

37:001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
           the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by
           Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
           governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high
           priest, saying,

37:001:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The
           time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be
           built.

37:001:003 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

37:001:004 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and
           this house lie waste?

37:001:005 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
           ways.

37:001:006 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
           not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
           clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
           earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

37:001:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

37:001:008 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
           and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
           the LORD.

37:001:009 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye
           brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
           hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every
           man unto his own house.

37:001:010 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
           earth is stayed from her fruit.

37:001:011 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
           mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon
           the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and
           upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
           hands.

37:001:012 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
           Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
           obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of
           Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and
           the people did fear before the LORD.

37:001:013 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message
           unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

37:001:014 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
           Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
           of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
           remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house
           of the LORD of hosts, their God,

37:001:015 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the
           second year of Darius the king.

37:002:001 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the
           month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai,
           saying,

37:002:002 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
           Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and
           to the residue of the people, saying,

37:002:003 Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory?
           and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison
           of it as nothing?

37:002:004 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be
           strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be
           strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work:
           for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

37:002:005 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came
           out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

37:002:006 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little
           while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
           sea, and the dry land;

37:002:007 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
           shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the
           LORD of hosts.

37:002:008 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of
           hosts.

37:002:009 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
           former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give
           peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

37:002:010 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the
           second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
           prophet, saying,

37:002:011 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning
           the law, saying,

37:002:012 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with
           his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any
           meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

37:002:013 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch
           any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered
           and said, It shall be unclean.

37:002:014 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is
           this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of
           their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.

37:002:015 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from
           before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the
           LORD:

37:002:016 Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty
           measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat
           for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but
           twenty.

37:002:017 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
           the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the
           LORD.

37:002:018 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and
           twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the
           foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.

37:002:019 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
           tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not
           brought forth: from this day will I bless you.

37:002:020 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four
           and twentieth day of the month, saying,

37:002:021 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake
           the heavens and the earth;

37:002:022 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will
           destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I
           will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and
           the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the
           sword of his brother.

37:002:023 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O
           Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD,
           and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith
           the LORD of hosts.
