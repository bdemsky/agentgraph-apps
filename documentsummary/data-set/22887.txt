THE

COURTSHIP, MARRIAGE, &c.

OF

_Cock Robin and Jenny Wren_.



[Illustration: THE COURTSHIP.]

  Says Robin to Jenny,
    If you will be mine,
  You shall eat pies and puddings,
    And drink currant-wine.

[Illustration: GENERAL INVITATION.]

  Jenny consented; the day was named,
  The joyful news the Cock proclaimed.


[Illustration: PARSON AND CLERK.]

  Together came the Rook and Lark,
  The one as Parson, t'other Clerk.

[Illustration: THE WEDDING.]

  The Goldfinch gave the bride away,
  Who promis'd always to obey.


[Illustration: PREPARING FOR THE FEAST.]

  The feathery tenants of the air
  Towards the Feast each gave a share.

[Illustration: THE DINNER.]

  The jovial party din'd together,
  And fine and pleasant was the weather.


[Illustration: THE CONCERT.]

  The Nightingale was then call'd on,
  To give the company a song.

[Illustration: A DUET.]

  The Linnet and the Goldfinch too,
  Both sung as sweet as they could do.


[Illustration: THE HAPPY PAIR.]

  And Robin and his pretty mate
  Together lived in happy state.

[Illustration: THE CRUEL HAWK.]

  But doleful to relate, one day,
  A Hawk with Jenny flew away:


[Illustration: DEATH OF POOR ROBIN.]

  And Robin, by a wicked Sparrow,
  Was shot dead with bow and arrow!




THE
DEATH AND BURIAL
OF
POOR COCK ROBIN.




[Illustration: POOR COCK ROBIN.]

  The Birds of the air fell to sighing and sobbing,
  When they heard the sad fate of poor Cock Robin.

[Illustration: THE CRUEL SPARROW.]

  This cruel Sparrow
  Kill'd Cock Robin with bow & arrow.


[Illustration: THE LITTLE FLY.]

  This little Fly
  Saw poor Cock Robin die.

[Illustration: THE FISH WITH HIS DISH.]

  This little Fish
  Caught his blood in the dish.


[Illustration: THE UNDERTAKER.]

  His shroud, by the Beetle,
  Was made with thread-and-needle.

[Illustration: THE SEXTON.]

  This Owl so brave
  Dug poor Cock Robin's grave.


[Illustration: THE BEARER.]

  His coffin, at night,
  Was borne by the Kite.

[Illustration: THE PARSON.]

  I, said the Rook,
  Will preach from my book.


[Illustration: THE CLERK.]

  Amen, said the Lark,
  Who assisted as Clerk.

[Illustration: THE LINK-BEARER.]

  To light them, the Linnet
  Fetched a Torch in a minute.


[Illustration: THE PALL-BEARERS.]

  These Wrens so small,
  Bore poor Cock Robin's pall

[Illustration: THE CHIEF-MOURNER.]

  Says the innocent Dove,
  I will mourn for my Love.


[Illustration: THE BELL-TOLLER.]

  The Bull tolled the Bell,
  For poor Cock Robin's funeral knell.

  All the birds in the air
    Fell to sighing and sobbing,
  When they heard the bell toll
    For poor Cock Robin:

  And vow'd that the Sparrow,
    Who his life took away,
  Should be tried for the murder
    The very next day.


  FINIS.
