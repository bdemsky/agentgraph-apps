Go to Sea Once More
(Traditional)

When first I come to Liverpool, I went upon a spree
Me money at last I spent it fast, got drunk as drunk could be
And when me money was all gone 'twas then that I wanted more
But a man must be blind or be out of his mind to go to sea once more

I spent that night with Angeline, too drunk to roll in bed
Me clothes they were new and me money was too in the morning with 'em
  she fled
And as I walked the streets alone, the whores they all did roar
There goes Jack Tarr, that poor sailor lad, he must go to sea once more

As I was walkin' down the street, I run into Rapper Brown
I asked him for to take me in and he looked at me with a frown
He said last time you was on-board with me you chalked no score
But I'll take your advance and I'll give you the chance and I'll send
  you to sea once more

He shipped me aboard of a whaling ship bound for the Arctic Sea
Where the cold winds blow through the frost and the snow and Jamaica
  rum would freeze
Alas I had no luck with me gear, for I'd spent all me money ashore
'Twas then that I wished that I was dead of safe with the girls ashore

Some days we catchin' whales me lads some days we catching none
With a twenty foot oar stuck in your hand from four o'clock in the morn'
And when the day is over lads, you sit on your weary oar
It's then that you wish that you were dead, you'd go to sea no more

So come all you bold seafaring lads who listen to my song
And when you go out on them long trips, pray that you don't go wrong
Take my advice, drink no strong drink, don't go sleepin' with no whore
But get married lads and have all night in and go to sea no more
