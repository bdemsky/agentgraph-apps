Book 64 3 John
001:001 The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
001:002 Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy,
        even as your soul prospers.
001:003 For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and testified
        about your truth, even as you walk in truth.
001:004 I have no greater joy than this, to hear about my children
        walking in truth.
001:005 Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish
        for those who are brothers and strangers.
001:006 They have testified about your love before the assembly.
        You will do well to send them forward on their journey
        in a manner worthy of God,
001:007 because for the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing
        from the Gentiles.
001:008 We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow
        workers for the truth.
001:009 I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first
        among them, doesn't accept what we say.
001:010 Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds
        which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words.
        Not content with this, neither does he himself receive
        the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws
        out of the assembly.
001:011 Beloved, don't imitate that which is evil, but that which is good.
        He who does good is of God.  He who does evil hasn't seen God.
001:012 Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself;
        yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.
001:013 I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write
        to you with ink and pen;
001:014 but I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face.
        Peace be to you.  The friends greet you.  Greet the friends by name.
