       AND OTHER RHYMES.




 McLOUGHLIN BRO'S 30 BEEKMAN St

    There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile,
    And he found a crooked six-pence against a crooked stile;
    He bought a crooked hat, which caught a crooked mouse,
    And they all lived together in a little crooked house.


    Go to bed Tom, go to bed Tom--
    Merry or sober, go to bed Tom.

      Little Tommy Grace,
      Had a pain in his face,
    So that he could not learn a letter;

[Illustration]

      When in came Dicky Long,
      Singing such a funny song,
    That Tommy laughed, and found his face much better.



    Shoe the horse, shoe the mare,
    Let the little colt go bare.

    A dog and a cat went out together,
    To see some friends just out of town;
    Said the cat to the dog, "What d'ye think of the weather?"
    "I think, Ma'am, the rain will come down."

[Illustration]

    "But don't be alarmed, for I've an umbrella
    That will shelter us both," said this amiable fellow.



    Oh, the rusty, dusty, rusty miller,
    I'll not change my wife for gold or siller.

        Jack be nimble,
        Jack be quick,
    And Jack jump over the candlestick.



    Hiccory, diccory, dock,
    The mouse ran up the clock;
    The clock struck one,
    The mouse ran down,
      Hiccory, diccory, dock.

        A horse and cart
        Had Billy Smart,
    To play with when it pleased him;
        The cart he'd load
        By the side of the road,
    And be happy if no one teased him.


[Illustration]

    Bow-wow-wow,
    Whose dog art thou?
    Little Tom Tucker's dog,
    Bow-wow-wow



    Hark! hark! the dogs do bark,
      Beggars are coming to town,
    Some in jags, and some in rags,
      And some in velvet gowns.
