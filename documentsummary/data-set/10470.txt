Nine Hundred Miles
(traditional)

Well, I'm walkin' down the track, I got tears in my eyes
Tryin' to read a letter from my home

Chorus:
If that train runs me right, I'll be home tomorrow night
'Cause it's nine hundred miles where I'm goin'.
And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow

Well, the train I ride on is a hundred coaches long
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.

Chorus

I will pawn you my watch, I will pawn you my chain
Pawn you my gold diamond ring.

Chorus

Well if you say so, I will railroad no more
Sidetrack my train and come home.
