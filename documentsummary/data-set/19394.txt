"You'll git dar in de mornin'!"

Music by H. T. Burleigh.

Words by F. L. Stanton.


Keep on lookin' fo' de bright, bright skies;
Keep on hopin' dat de sun'll rise,
Keep on singin' when de whole world sighs,
An' you'll git dar in de mornin'!

Keep on plowin' when you've miss'd de crops;
Keep on dancin' when de fiddle stops;
Keep on faithful till de curtain drops,
An' you'll git dar in de mornin'!
