[Footnote 1: Prior to the posting to PG of this illustrated De Luxe
edition, volume VI (etext 18642) and volume VII (etext 17159) had been
posted, using the standard edition as a source. In the standard edition,
only one illustration is used as a frontispiece and it is different from
the frontispiece in the De Luxe edition. PG's production of the standard
edition of Volume VII is missing this frontispiece, possibly due to a
low quality scan that made the illustration unusable.]
