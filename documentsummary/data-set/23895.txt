PREFACE


Well, I must buckle to, and put a good face (pre-face) on the matter as
I have to introduce the latest addition to the already considerable
family of Crane-reprints.

Here we have those delightful rigmaroles "ONE, TWO, BUCKLE MY SHOE" and
"A GAPING-WIDE-Mouth-WADDLING-FROG": but what, it may be asked is "MY
MOTHER" doing in such company? I shrewdly suspect, if we knew the truth,
that she is really the author of both. It is probable, however, that
both legends have been transmitted through a long line of mothers,
assisted perhaps, by nurses, but I had them direct from my Mother.

A pleasing romance of domestic incident runs through "One, Two, Buckle
my shoe", while the "Waddling Frog" shows a rich and sumptuous
imagination, if a little inconsequent, except numerically; but if he
sets us agape with astonishment, his own "Wide-Mouth" seems capacious
enough to swallow all the marvels by land or sea which he enumerates.

These two are quite early Cranes--almost pre-historic (please notice,
however, the up-to-date additions): "My Mother" is mid-Victorian--just
after crinolines had gone out--but mothers are always in fashion, bless
them,--and you also, dear children, whether of the old or the new world,
who, having chosen your parents wisely, have become possessors of this
book, may your shoes never want buckling, and if by any mischance you
should lose one, may Good Luck always find a spare one for you, and so
set you on your feet again.

MY MOTHER.

Who fed me from her gentle breast,
And hush'd me in her arms to rest,
And on my cheek sweet kisses prest?
    My Mother.

When sleep forsook my open eye,
Who was it sung sweet hushaby,
And rock'd me that I should not cry?
    My Mother.

[Illustration]

Who sat and watched my infant head,
When sleeping in my cradle bed,
And tears of sweet affection shed?
    My Mother.

When pain and sickness made me cry,
Who gazed upon my heavy eye,
And wept for fear that I should die?
    My Mother.

[Illustration]

Who dress'd my doll in clothes so gay,
And taught me pretty how to play.
And minded all I had to say?
    My Mother.

[Illustration]

Who taught my infant lips to pray,
And love GOD's holy book and day.
And walk in Wisdom's pleasant way?
    My Mother.

And can I ever cease to be
Affectionate and kind to thee,
Who was so very kind to me,
    My Mother?

Ah, no! the thought I cannot bear;
And if GOD please my life to spare,
I hope I shall reward thy care,
    My Mother.

[Illustration]

Who ran to help me when I fell,
And would some pretty story tell,
Or kiss the place to make it well?
    My Mother.

[Illustration]

When thou art feeble, old, and gray,
My healthy arm shall be thy stay,
And I will soothe thy pains away.
    My Mother.

[Illustration]

And when I see thee hang thy head,
'Twill be my turn to watch _thy_ bed.
And tears of sweet affection shed,
    My Mother.

For GOD, who lives above the skies,
Would look with vengeance in His eyes,
If I should ever dare despise
    My Mother.
