Book 34        Nahum

34:001:001 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
           Elkoshite.

34:001:002 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
           and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his
           adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.

34:001:003 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
           all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind
           and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

34:001:004 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
           rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of
           Lebanon languisheth.

34:001:005 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth
           is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell
           therein.

34:001:006 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
           fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and
           the rocks are thrown down by him.

34:001:007 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
           knoweth them that trust in him.

34:001:008 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
           place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

34:001:009 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter
           end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.

34:001:010 For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they
           are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble
           fully dry.

34:001:011 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the
           LORD, a wicked counsellor.

34:001:012 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many,
           yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through.
           Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

34:001:013 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst
           thy bonds in sunder.

34:001:014 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no
           more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I
           cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy
           grave; for thou art vile.

34:001:015 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
           tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn
           feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass
           through thee; he is utterly cut off.

34:002:001 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the
           munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy
           power mightily.

34:002:002 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
           excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out,
           and marred their vine branches.

34:002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are
           in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the
           day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly
           shaken.

34:002:004 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one
           against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like
           torches, they shall run like the lightnings.

34:002:005 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their
           walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the
           defence shall be prepared.

34:002:006 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall
           be dissolved.

34:002:007 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up,
           and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves,
           tabering upon their breasts.

34:002:008 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall
           flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look
           back.

34:002:009 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there
           is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant
           furniture.

34:002:010 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and
           the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and
           the faces of them all gather blackness.

34:002:011 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of
           the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked,
           and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

34:002:012 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and
           strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey,
           and his dens with ravin.

34:002:013 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will
           burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy
           young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and
           the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.

34:003:001 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery;
           the prey departeth not;

34:003:002 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the
           wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping
           chariots.

34:003:003 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the
           glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a
           great number of carcases; and there is none end of their
           corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:

34:003:004 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
           harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations
           through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

34:003:005 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
           discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations
           thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

34:003:006 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee
           vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.

34:003:007 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee
           shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will
           bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?

34:003:008 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the
           rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was
           the sea, and her wall was from the sea?

34:003:009 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put
           and Lubim were thy helpers.

34:003:010 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
           children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
           streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all
           her great men were bound in chains.

34:003:011 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt
           seek strength because of the enemy.

34:003:012 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the
           firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into
           the mouth of the eater.

34:003:013 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates
           of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the
           fire shall devour thy bars.

34:003:014 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go
           into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

34:003:015 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee
           off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself
           many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.

34:003:016 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
           the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.

34:003:017 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
           grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but
           when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not
           known where they are.

34:003:018 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall
           dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
           and no man gathereth them.

34:003:019 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all
           that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee:
           for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
