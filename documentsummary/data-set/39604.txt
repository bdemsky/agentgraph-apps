INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Mr. H. M. Bateman possesses in remarkable degree that
rare gift, a real power of comic draughtsmanship. He is
capable not only of comic vision, but of comic expression.
His "line" is an instinctive expression of the comic: it reveals an
innate feeling for the essentially humorous. To put it briefly, if
somewhat vaguely, he "draws funnily." He is the terse and witty
pictorial _raconteur_--a shrewd observer who can sum up a character,
or conjure up a scene, with a few strokes of such penetrating insight
that they carry instant conviction.

Humour of the kind which the drawings in this volume embody
is so spontaneous, and the expression of it so direct and incisive,
that there is perhaps a tendency to overlook the intensity of the effort
which produces the seemingly effortless result. Mr. Bateman's
method is sometimes described as caricature, but that is to miss its
true significance, though the term may seem, upon the surface,
appropriate enough. Caricature is the art of inducing humour, by
dint of satirical exaggeration, in a subject not necessarily humorous
of itself. Mr. Bateman's more difficult function is to reveal humour,
not to impose it.

There is no trace of the self-conscious humorist in these drawings.
Facetiousness is a quality conspicuously and gratefully absent. The
artist's only concern is to pluck the very heart out of his subject, and
that his mind has a trend towards the humorous aspect of life is merely
accidental. For it is the humour of life, not merely of men, that
attracts him, and even when he deals with seemingly quite trivial
subjects, there is nothing petty or trite about his comic treatment of
them.

He generalises. His observations are of types, not of individuals,
of situations rather than of scenes. He draws for us people whom
we all know but none of us have actually seen, for when he portrays
a type his sketch embodies all the salient characteristics that go to
make that type. If he draws a plumber, for example, he shows us
the Compleat Plumber--more like a plumber than any plumber ever
was. And as with character, so with action--whatever Mr. Bateman
elects to make his puppets do, they do it with an intensity and vigour
beyond all practical possibility, but not (and this is the artist's secret)
beyond the bounds of imagination and belief. When a man is seen
running in a Bateman drawing he does not merely run--he _runs_; if
he slumbers, one can veritably hear him snore! The intensity of the
artist's imaginative effort visualises for us that which cannot humanly
be, but would be if it could.

Pictorial exponents of the comic art are few, for of so-called
"humorous drawings" not many are inspired by the true comic spirit.
It is a fortunate opportunity, therefore, which the present volume
provides of preserving in collected form so much that bears the
evident stamp of the real thing.
