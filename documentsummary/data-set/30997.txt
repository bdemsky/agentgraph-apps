 A New Bat (Genus Leptonycteris)
 From Coahuila

 BY
 HOWARD J. STAINS
 Assistant Professor, Department of Zoology, Southern Illinois University


In a collection of mammals obtained in Coahuila, Mexico, there is a
series of 24 long-nosed bats, _Leptonycteris nivalis_. These bats have a
larger skull and a longer third finger than other bats of this species
found to the south of Coahuila. On the basis of these distinctive
characters, it seems appropriate to recognize these long-nosed bats
from Coahuila as belonging to a new subspecies, named and described
as follows:


#Leptonycteris nivalis longala# new subspecies

     _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull, No. 33087, Univ. Kansas
     Mus. Nat. Hist.; 12 mi. S and 2 mi. E Arteaga, 7500 ft., Coahuila;
     11 July 1949; obtained by W. K. Clark, original number 787.

     _Range._--Southern Coahuila north to the Big Bend (Brewster County)
     of Texas.

     _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); third finger long;
     color pale, upperparts Hair Brown (capitalized color terms are
     after Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington,
     D. C., 1912), underparts Smoke Gray; skull large and broad.

     _Comparisons._--From _Leptonycteris nivalis nivalis_ (specimens
     from Veracruz, Oaxaca, Distrito Federal, Hidalgo, Jalisco, and
     Sonora), _L. n. longala_ differs as follows: color paler, more
     whitish and less brownish; third finger longer (_longala_ from
     Coahuila averaging 111.3 mm.; _nivalis_ from Sonora averaging 91.0,
     from Jalisco 96.4, from Hidalgo 98.0, from Veracruz 100.0, from
     Distrito Federal 100.2, and from Oaxaca 98.6); skull larger,
     breadth of cranium greater (_longala_ from Coahuila averaging 10.7
     mm.; _nivalis_ from Sonora 9.8, from Jalisco 9.8, from Hidalgo 9.6,
     from Veracruz 9.9, from Distrito Federal 9.9, and from Oaxaca 9.8);
     mastoidal breadth greater (_longala_ from Coahuila averaging 11.6
     mm.; _nivalis_ from Sonora 10.5, from Jalisco 10.8, from Hidalgo
     10.6, from Veracruz 10.9, from Distrito Federal 10.8, and from
     Oaxaca 10.7); skull higher (_longala_ from Coahuila averaging 10.0
     mm.; _nivalis_ from Sonora 9.3, from Jalisco 9.2, from Hidalgo 9.2,
     from Veracruz 9.3, from Distrito Federal 9.3, and from Oaxaca 9.1).
     The average of each dimension of _longala_ listed above exceeds the
     maximum of the corresponding dimension in _nivalis_.

     _Remarks._--_Leptonycteris nivalis longala_ inhabits the
     northeastern end of the Mexican Plateau. Bats from Brewster County,
     Texas, referred to _longala_, average slightly larger in all
     measurements taken than do specimens from southern Coahuila.
     Specimens from Cerro Potosi, Municipio de Galeana, Nuevo Leon, also
     are referred to _longala_ on the basis of the length of their third
     fingers. Like the specimens from Texas, these bats possess longer
     forearms, on the average, than do bats from Coahuila.

     Topotypes of _L. n. nivalis_ from Mount Orizaba were not available,
     but 111 specimens referable to the subspecies _nivalis_ were
     examined. These specimens were from the following places: _Sonora_:
     1/4 mi. W Aduana, 1600 ft., 4 specimens. _Jalisco_: Hda. San
     Martin, 5000 ft., 18 mi. W Chapala, 3; 11 mi. W Chapala, 5000 ft.,
     1; 5 mi. W Chapala, 5000 ft., 58; 8 mi. NE Ocotlan, 5100 ft., 1.
     _Hidalgo_: 6 km. NW Tasquillo, 500 ft., 1. _Veracruz_: 3 km. W Boca
     del Rio, 25 ft., 22. _Distrito Federal_: Chicomostoc, Cerro Teutli,
     2-2/5 mi. NNW Milpa Alta, 2620 ft., 18. _Oaxaca_: Cuicatlan, 600
     ft., 1; 3 km. WNW Dominguillo, 730 ft., 2. All these specimens are
     in the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas.
     Little discernible geographic variation was found in these
     specimens of _L. n. nivalis_. No specimens could, with certainty,
     be classed as intergrades between _longala_ and _nivalis_, but it
     is thought that intergrades will be found in western San Luis
     Potosi or in Zacatecas or in both states. Dalquest (Mammals of the
     Mexican State of San Luis Potosi, Louisiana State Univ. Studies,
     Biol. Sci. Ser. No. 1, pp. 27-28, 1953) refers five specimens taken
     from Hda. Capulin, southeastern San Luis Potosi, to _L. n.
     nivalis_. Measurements by Dalquest are in accordance with other
     measurements of _L. n. nivalis_ listed above.

     The name _L. n. yerbabuenae_ Martinez and Villa, was based on
     specimens from Yerbabuena in the state of Guerrero. The specimens,
     including the holotype, on which this name was based have been
     destroyed. Luis de la Torre (Fieldiana, 37:698, 1955) examined a
     topotype of _yerbabuenae_ and was unable to distinguish this
     specimen from a topotype of _nivalis_ from Orizaba. Davis and
     Russell (Jour. Mamm., 33:236, 1952) identified as _L. n. nivalis_
     one bat from Morelos, taken approximately 32 miles NE of the type
     locality of _yerbabuenae_, noting that its third finger was much
     shorter than in specimens from the Big Bend of Texas. I judge _L.
     n. yerbabuenae_ to be a synonym of _nivalis_ as does de la Torre.

     Acknowledgment is made to Dr. W. B. Davis of the Agricultural and
     Mechanical College of Texas and Mr. Colin C. Sanborn of the Chicago
     Natural History Museum for loan of comparative material. I am
     grateful also to the Kansas University Endowment Association and
     National Science Foundation for support of field work, and to Dr.
     Rollin H. Baker for guidance in my study.

     _Measurements._--The following measurements in millimeters include
     those of the type, and the average and extreme measurements of the
     type and 22 adult topotypes: total length, 79, 79 (73-86); length
     of hind foot, 16, 16 (14-17); length of ear, 16, 16.5 (15-17);
