Sailing Across the Lagoon to his Station

The Man Tematau Came to the Door

Met Me With Outstretched Hand

Hand Shot out and Grasped Me by the Throat

Krause Lay on his Back in the Centre of The Room

Directed My Steps Towards the Great Open-sided Moniep

Fishing As if Nothing Unusual Had Occurred

I Spread the Chart out on The Table

I Hurried Down to the Beach

Two Good Coatings of Red Lead

Accompanied by Thirty Or Forty Canoes

Began Their Flying-fish Catching

She Came Boldly on

How We Escaped Broaching to

I Could Not But Admire and Envy

Carrying Nets and Fish Baskets

I Waited Until My Hand Was a Bit Steady

A Glorious Silver Moon in the Sky

Saw a Barque Lying on the Reef

He Had Sailed

At Last We Reached the Ship

Lifting Us up on the Summit of Its Awful Crest
