  Night falls in the Ti-Tree,
    Dusk fades from the hill--
  The Frogs on their banjoes
    Are strumming their fill
                With a will.

  Banjoes in the near pond
    Bones in the other--
  In ecstasy Crickets
    Outshrill one another.
          Shrill.... Shrill....

  The Birds are all hushed now
    The moon's in the sky--
  Around and around us
    The little Bats fly,
                  Waveringly.

  The Rabbits have nibbled
    Sweet grass on the furrow,
  Have frisking and flirting
    Loped to their burrow,
          Safe on their burrow.

  Are you glad, little Rabbits
    To have played yet a day?
  Does no foresight show you
    What may happen some day?
                  Wellaway!

  For commonest, direst,
    Of wild folk's mishaps
  Is to find yourselves caught in
    Man's merciless traps--
            Devil's own snaps.




  They set them and lay them
    In your very door,
  Then craftily strew them
    With sand and leaves o'er,
              Craftily o'er.


[Illustration]




  You step out unwitting,
    Bright moon inviting--
  Ah! What a spring when
    You taste its fierce biting;
          Steel chain affrighting,

  You scream in your anguish,
    A mute thing by kind!
  You make but the search easy
    When Death comes to find,
            O easily find!


[Illustration]




  Yet God was on your side,
    Else why did He make
  Such long ears to hearken?
    Such bright eyes to wake?


[Illustration]




  And so, little Rabbits,
    In danger some day,
  Remember Who's for you,
    Flirt tails and away!
