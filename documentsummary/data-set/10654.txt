St. James Infirmary Blues
(Traditional)

I went down to St. James Infirmary,
Saw my baby there.
Set down on a long white table,
So sweet, so cold, so fair.

Let her go, let her go, God bless her,
Wherever she may be,
She can look this wide world over,
She'll never find a sweet man like me.

When I die, want you to dress me in straight leg shoes,
Box back coat and a Stetson hat,
Put a 20 dollar gold piece on my watch chain,
So the boys'll know I died standing pat.

Now you've heard my sad story,
Boy hand me another shot of that booze;
If anyone should ask you,
Tell 'em I got those St. James Infirmary blues.
