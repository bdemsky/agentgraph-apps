BRITISH SPORTS, for the Amusement of CHILDREN


[Illustration: PHEASANT SHOOTING.]

    See the Fowler takes his aim,
    To bring down the feather'd game;
    September Season is the time,
    When these birds are in full prime.

[Illustration]

RABBIT SHOOTING.


    How happy & frisky the Rabbits appear,
    Prancing & skipping without any fear;
    But alas, their enjoyment is like to be short,
    By the aim of a Gunner who seeks them for sport.




[Illustration]

    BADGER BAITING.


    Baited by Dogs, the Badger dies,
    A cruel sport it thus supplies,
    The Skin is by the Furriers bought,
    And thus for gain & pleasure sought.




[Illustration]

HORSE RACING.


    Goaded with Spurs they seem to fly,
    Like lightning to the human eye,
    Stretch out their necks to gain the post,
    While thousands on the course are lost.




[Illustration]

STAG HUNT.


    The timid Stag with eager bounds,
    Strives to escape pursuing Hounds;
    In vain he flies he's doom'd to die,
    Whilst shouts of Huntsmen rend the Sky.




[Illustration]

COURSING.


    They beat the Bush to find a Hare,
    And thus for a long chace prepare;
    Poor gentle Puss thy fate is hard,
    And it with pity I regard.




[Illustration]

FOX CHACE.


    The Fox is Reynard sly and cunning,
    Often with our Poultry running;
    To hunt him yields a manly sport,
    And numbers to the chace resort.




[Illustration]

ANGLING.


    Angling will oft our patience try,
    Ere we a dish of Fish supply;
    Yet many love the rural sport,
    And to the Brook or Lake resort.
