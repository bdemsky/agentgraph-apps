ADORNED WITH CUTS



[Illustration: FRONTISPIECE]

  Here you may see what's very rare,
    The world turn'd upside down;
  A tree and castle in the air,
    A man walk on his crown.

  To see a butcher kill a hog, is no news;
  But to see a hare run after a dog, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]


  This hare hunts the dog,
    Tho' all of you know,
  Most dogs hunt the hare--
    But here it's not so.



  To see a poor man and a rich, is no news;
  But to see the devil hugging a witch, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Is your name Nick, sir,
    Or Old Harry,
  I insist you tell before
    We marry.



  To see a cat catching a mouse, is no news;
  But to see a rat building a house, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Some rats take delight to gnaw
    Houses down--
  I want to build a good
    House of my own.



  To see a bird picking at fruit, is no news;
  But to see a dog playing the flute, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  You see I am playing here,
    Too, too, too, too;
  When I've done with my flute,
    I'll give it to you.



  To see a greyhound catch a hare, is no news;
  But to see a lamb hunting a bear, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  The bear runs away, the
    Lamb is pursuing;
  If he catches the bear,
    There'll be terrible doing.



  To see an eagle spread her wings, is no news;
  But to see an old  man in leading strings, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Take care, grandpapa, lest
    You should fall,
  And if you want your
    Chair--pray call.



  To see a weaver throw his shuttle, is no news;
  But to see a man get in a quart bottle, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  You'll all be amazed to
    See me get in,
  And much more surprised
    If I get out again.



  To hear of a Frenchman eating a frog, is no news;
  But to see a butcher stuck by a hog, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Don't hollo!
    'Tis only a knife,
  You never stuck a pig
     So easy in your life.



  To see a gardener gather a salad, is no news;
  But to see an ass singing a ballad, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  My voice is so fine,
    And so charming the tune,
  I expect for to sing at
    The opera soon.



  To see a man get a boat, is no news;
  But to see a man jump down his throat, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  If I once get my legs in
    As far as my knees,
  The rest will slip down
    With a great deal of ease.



  To see a dog baiting a bull, is no news;
  But to see a ram spinning of wool, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Good lack a daisy!
    How you grin,
  To see a poor ram
    Try to spin.



  To see a tailor making a coat, is no news;
  But to see a hog rowing a boat, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Step into my boat,
    I'll give you a row,
  I'm an excellent waterman,
    All of you know.



  To see a man fish in a moat, is no news;
  But to see a monkey shaving a goat, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  My lather is good, and
    My razor is keen,
  In two minutes time,
    I'll shave you quite clean.



  To see a miller grinding corn, is no news;
  But to see an ox blowing a horn, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  I blow and I run,
    And I run and I blow,
  And which I do best,
    I'm sure I don't know.



  To see a shoemaker hammer his leather, is no news;
  But to see a hound and a buck drinking together, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Mr. Buck, I wish you luck.
  Mr. Hound, your most profound.



  To see a good boy read his book, is no news;
  But to see a goose roasting a cook, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  I'll roast ye, and baste ye,
  But who will may taste ye.



  To see a beau at his toilet dress, is no news;
  But to see two horses playing at chess, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Mr. Horse, you don't play
    Fair, but cheat:
  Mr. Nag, you say so,
    Now you're beat.



  To see a high-bred horse when prancing, is no news;
  But to see a cat fiddling and mice all dancing, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Come foot it, my dears,
    And when you've done,
  I'll eat you for supper,
    Aye, every one.



  To see a lady drinking of tea, is no news;
  But to see a bird shoot a man in a tree, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  First of all, I'll shoot this clown,
  And then I'll bring his bow wow down.



  To see a boy swim in a brook, is no news;
  But to see a fish catch a man with hook, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Spare me, good Mr. Fish,
    I didn't molest you.
  I'll spare you no longer
    Than till I dress you.



  To see a cat steal milk from a pan, is no news;
  But to see a buck hunting a man, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Hark forward, huzza,
    He can't get away:
  And he's not buck enough
    To stand at a bay.



  To see a cobbler mending a shoe, is no news;
  But to see a goat cry old clothes like a jew, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  'Tis alvays my vay,
    To cheat ven I can,
  Yet for all that I be
    A very goot man.



  To see a haymaker using of rakes, is no news;
  But to see a bear making plum cakes, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  What I have got in the pan,
    I shall eat if I can,
  And this cake on the shelf,
    I shall keep for myself.



  To see a barrel made by a cooper, is no news,
  But to see a goat act the part of a trooper, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Hur will fight hur foes
    For the honour of Wales,
  And if the French come,
    They shall turn their tails.



  To see wrestlers kicking shins, is no news;
  But to see cats playing at nine pins, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  I'll lay a penny, you don't get many.
  I'll knock down all, and swallow the ball.



  To hear a parrot say, pretty Poll, is no news;
  But to see a sow with a parasol, is strange indeed!


[Illustration]

  Like a lady I shine,
    I'm so fat and so fine;
  I've a right I suppose,
    To a shade for my nose.
