Book 63 2 John
001:001 The Elder to the elect lady and her children.  Truly I love
        you all, and not I alone, but also all who know the truth,
001:002 for the sake of the truth which is continually in our hearts
        and will be with us for ever.
001:003 Grace, mercy and peace will be with us from God the Father,
        and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
001:004 It is an intense joy to me to have found some of your children
        living true Christian lives, in obedience to the command
        which we have received from the Father.
001:005 And now, dear lady, I pray you--writing to you, as I do,
        not a new command, but the one which we have had from
        the very beginning--let us love one another.
001:006 The love of which I am speaking consists in our living in obedience
        to God's commands.  God's command is that you should live
        in obedience to what you all heard from the very beginning.
001:007 For many deceivers have gone out into the world--men who do not
        acknowledge Jesus as Christ who has come in human nature.
        Such a one is `the deceiver' and `the anti-Christ.'
001:008 Keep guard over yourselves, so that you may not lose the results
        of your good deeds, but may receive back a full reward.
001:009 No one has God, who instead of remaining true to the teaching
        of Christ, presses on in advance:  but he who remains true
        to that teaching has both the Father and the Son.
001:010 If any one who comes to you does not bring this teaching,
        do not receive him under your roof nor bid him Farewell.
001:011 He who bids him Farewell is a sharer in his evil deeds.
001:012 I have a great deal to say to you all, but will not write it
        with paper and ink.  Yet I hope to come to see you and speak
        face to face, so that your happiness may be complete.
001:013 The children of your elect sister send greetings to you.
