    They laid COCK ROBIN in his grave,
    And after that they sung a stave,
    And then they sent to fetch the sparrow
    Who kill'd him with the bow and arrow.

    Says JUSTICE HAWK
      I do assure ye,
    We'll try the rogue,
      By Judge and Jury.

    The JUDGE AND JURY being met,
    And plac'd in order down they set,
    Or else they stood upon their feet,
    Because I think they'd ne'er a seat.

    [Illustration]

    Says the Judge to the Jury,
      I'd have you take care,
    When a bird's life's at stake,
      Its a serious affair.

      The CUCKOO came in
    And began for to hollow
    As he dragg'd the poor Sparrow,
      In fast by the collar;

    [Illustration]

    When I found him, my Lord,
      He was robbing a barn;
    He must live by thieving,
      Since nothing he'll earn.

    Says the SPARROW its false,
      Both me and my wife,
    Are as honest as ever
      You was in your life.

    [Illustration]

    A few grains of wheat
      Lay at the barn door,
    We pick'd them all up,
      And did nothing more.

    Says MAG that has nothing
      To do with the matter,
    I saw when you shot,
      And began for to chatter.

    [Illustration]

    I call'd DOCTOR PUSS
      To examine the wound,
    He knows what he saw,
      And he'll tell, I'll be bound.

    Says PUSS I'm a doctor,
      So mind what I say,
    I happen'd to pass on
      The very same day.

    [Illustration]

    I saw the poor Robin,
      The Sparrow had shot.
    He was quite dead and Cold,
      So was not very hot.

    Says the DOG I ran out
      From my kennel adjacent,
    Or I believe Doctor Puss
      Would have eaten his patient.

    [Illustration]

    However Cock Robin,
      Was dead, I believe,
    And that is the reason
      That all of you grieve.

    [Illustration]

    Says the PIG I was hastily call'd from my stye,
    But just too late to see poor Robin die;
    I was ask'd by the Dog if I thought he was dead,
    Ah! both dead and cold was the answer I made.

    Says the ASS I was
      Coroner in this affair,
    We found Robin wounded,
      But could not tell where.

    [Illustration]

    We put on our spectacles,
      Those who had got 'em,
    And found that his wound
      Lay just in his bottom.

    Says the DRAKE I was swimming
        Along with my Duck,
    The Sparrow sat on a tree
        Just by the brook.

    [Illustration]

    He took up his arrow,
        And likewise his bow,
    And he shot, I believe,
        But I'm sure I don't know.

    Says the SWAN I was driving
      Along with the stream,
    Between sleep and awake,
      In a sort of a dream.

    [Illustration]

    I saw the sharp arrow
      Fly from the bow;
    I'm sure that I saw it,
      Or else I dreamt so.

    Says the COCK I was standing,
      And thinking no harm,
    When I saw Robin fall,
      I gave the alarm.

    [Illustration]

    I gave the alarm
       With such a loud crow,
    If he'd been but asleep,
     I'd have wak'd him I know.

    [Illustration]

    The TURKEY was suddenly rous'd by a noise,
    Which he knew to be Mr. Chanticlear's voice;
    When the Bat he beheld in pursuit of the Sparrow,
    But never saw either his bow or his arrow.

    Says the BAT I was constable,
       Sir, of the night,
    Though my candle was out,
       I've a pretty good sight.

    [Illustration]

    I pursu'd the murderer
       To the barn door,
    He was took by the Cuckoo,
       I know nothing more.

    [Illustration]

    Says the APE I saw the Sparrow take flight
    The Cock gave the alarm and my beast he took fright,
    And good reason I have to remember it well,
    For upon the hard ground on my bottom I fell!

    Says JUDGE HAWKE you are
      Such a murdering elf,
    I think I shall kill you,
      And eat you myself.

    [Illustration]

    So he eat up the Sparrow,
      The rest got away,
    They thought it not safe
      Near such Justice to stay.
