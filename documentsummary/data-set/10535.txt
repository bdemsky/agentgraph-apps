10535.midi
10535.pdf

  -The final project I generated from the include source files.
   The midi file is importable into other software.  The pdf
   was created with an A4 paper size.

10535.mp3

  -The midi file played through a sequencer using real
   Steinway piano samples.  Much nicer than the midi for those
   who just want to hear what it should sound like.

10535.ly

  -The primary source file. Contains all the music markup.

10535-book.tex

  -A lilypond-book wrapper which allows us to generate a pdf
   with the frontispiece and additional lyrics (like the one
   included here).

10535-frontis.jpg
10535-frontis.eps

  -The frontispiece image used by 10535-book.tex. The
   jpg is the original, but the software needs eps format to
   compile.
