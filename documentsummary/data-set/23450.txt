                    PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.


As there are no works of Ancient Alphabets of any excellence published
in a cheap form, I have been induced, after many years' study and
research in my profession as a Draughtsman and Engraver, to offer this
collection to the favourable notice of the public, trusting that its
very moderate price and general usefulness will be a sufficient
apology for the undertaking.

The demand for a Fourth Edition within so short a period of the
publication of the Third, has convinced me in the most agreeable
manner that it has been a work required by the public. To render it
still more worthy of their attention, I have here introduced some
additions, likely to enhance the interest and increase the value of
the pages, as an indication of the esteem in which I have held the
encouragement, and the respect I have paid to the suggestions of the
purchasers of this book, and the critics by whom it has been so
liberally reviewed.
