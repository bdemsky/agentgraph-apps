Book 56 Titus
001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
        according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge
        of the truth which is according to godliness,
001:002 in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie,
        promised before time began;
001:003 but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I
        was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;
001:004 to Titus, my true child according to a common faith:
        Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the
        Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
001:005 I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order
        the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city,
        as I directed you;
001:006 if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children
        who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.
001:007 For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward;
        not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine,
        not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
001:008 but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded,
        fair, holy, self-controlled;
001:009 holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching,
        that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine,
        and to convict those who contradict him.
001:010 For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers,
        especially those of the circumcision,
001:011 whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses,
        teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.
001:012 One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars,
        evil beasts, and idle gluttons."
001:013 This testimony is true.  For this cause, reprove them sharply,
        that they may be sound in the faith,
001:014 not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men
        who turn away from the truth.
001:015 To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled
        and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their
        conscience are defiled.
001:016 They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him,
        being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
002:001 But say the things which fit sound doctrine,
002:002 that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded,
        sound in faith, in love, and in patience:
002:003 and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior,
        not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that
        which is good;
002:004 that they may train the young women to love their husbands,
        to love their children,
002:005 to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in
        subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may
        not be blasphemed.
002:006 Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;
002:007 in all things showing yourself an example of good works;
        in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,
002:008 and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes
        you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.
002:009 Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters,
        and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
002:010 not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn
        the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.
002:011 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
002:012 instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and
        worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly
        in this present world;
002:013 looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our
        great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;
002:014 who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
        and purify for himself a people for his own possession,
        zealous for good works.
002:015 Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority.
        Let no man despise you.
003:001 Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities,
        to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
003:002 to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle,
        showing all humility toward all men.
003:003 For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived,
        serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice
        and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
003:004 But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love
        toward mankind appeared,
003:005 not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves,
        but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing
        of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
003:006 whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
003:007 that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs
        according to the hope of eternal life.
003:008 This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I
        desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have
        believed God may be careful to maintain good works.
        These things are good and profitable to men;
003:009 but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes
        about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
003:010 Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;
003:011 knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
003:012 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come
        to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.
003:013 Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily,
        that nothing may be lacking for them.
003:014 Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses,
        that they may not be unfruitful.
003:015 All who are with me greet you.  Greet those who love us in faith.
        Grace be with you all.  Amen.
