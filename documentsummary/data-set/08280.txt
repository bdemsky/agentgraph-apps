Book 53 2 Thessalonians
001:001 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians
        in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:
001:002 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
001:003 We are bound to always give thanks to God for you,
        brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where context
        allows may also be correctly translated "brothers and sisters"
        or "siblings."} even as it is appropriate, because your faith
        grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you
        towards one another abounds;
001:004 so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God
        for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in
        the afflictions which you endure.
001:005 This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God,
        to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God,
        for which you also suffer.
001:006 Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction
        to those who afflict you,
001:007 and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us,
        when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty
        angels in flaming fire,
001:008 giving vengeance to those who don't know God, and to those
        who don't obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,
001:009 who will pay the penalty:  eternal destruction from the face
        of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
001:010 when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired
        among all those who have believed (because our testimony
        to you was believed) in that day.
001:011 To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may
        count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire
        of goodness and work of faith, with power;
001:012 that the name of our Lord Jesus{TR adds "Christ"} may be
        glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace
        of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
002:001 Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        and our gathering together to him, we ask you
002:002 not to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled,
        either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us,
        saying that the day of Christ had come.
002:003 Let no one deceive you in any way.  For it will not be,
        unless the departure comes first, and the man of sin is revealed,
        the son of destruction,
002:004 he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called
        God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple
        of God, setting himself up as God.
002:005 Don't you remember that, when I was still with you, I told
        you these things?
002:006 Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may
        be revealed in his own season.
002:007 For the mystery of lawlessness already works.  Only there
        is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way.
002:008 Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill
        with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation
        of his coming;
002:009 even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan
        with all power and signs and lying wonders,
002:010 and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost,
        because they didn't receive the love of the truth, that they
        might be saved.
002:011 Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they
        should believe a lie;
002:012 that they all might be judged who didn't believe the truth,
        but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
002:013 But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you,
        brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the
        beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit
        and belief in the truth;
002:014 to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining
        of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
002:015 So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you
        were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter.
002:016 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved
        us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
002:017 comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.
003:001 Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord
        may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you;
003:002 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men;
        for not all have faith.
003:003 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard
        you from the evil one.
003:004 We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both
        do and will do the things we command.
003:005 May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God,
        and into the patience of Christ.
003:006 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks
        in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they
        received from us.
003:007 For you know how you ought to imitate us.  For we didn't behave
        ourselves rebelliously among you,
003:008 neither did we eat bread from anyone's hand without paying
        for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day,
        that we might not burden any of you;
003:009 not because we don't have the right, but to make ourselves
        an example to you, that you should imitate us.
003:010 For even when we were with you, we commanded you this:
        "If anyone will not work, neither let him eat."
003:011 For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don't
        work at all, but are busybodies.
003:012 Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the
        Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat
        their own bread.
003:013 But you, brothers, don't be weary in doing well.
003:014 If any man doesn't obey our word in this letter, note that man,
        that you have no company with him, to the end that he
        may be ashamed.
003:015 Don't count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
003:016 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times
        in all ways.  The Lord be with you all.
003:017 The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign
        in every letter:  this is how I write.
003:018 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.
