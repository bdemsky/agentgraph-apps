commit further outrages in Armenia.

DAME EUROPA. "YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE MOST TROUBLESOME BOY IN THE SCHOOL.

bitter blow to Germany.

[Illustration: HIS MASTER'S VOICE.

THE KAISER (_to Turkey, reassuringly_). "LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME. ALL
YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TO EXPLODE."

OVER?"

_November 11, 1914._]

There is, indeed, no health in the Turk.
