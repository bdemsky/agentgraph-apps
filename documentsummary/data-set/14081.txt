THE THREE JOVIAL HUNTSMEN







[Illustration: The Three Jovial Huntsmen]

[Illustration]



It's of three jovial huntsmen, an' a hunting they did go;
    An' they hunted, an' they hollo'd, an' they blew their horns also
                                            Look ye there!

[Illustration]

An' one said, "Mind yo'r e'en, an' keep yo'r noses reet i' th' wind
    An' then, by scent or seet, we'll leet o' summat to our mind."
                                            Look ye there!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

They hunted, an' they hollo'd, an' the first thing they did find
Was a tatter't boggart, in a field, an' that they left behind.
                                            Look ye there!

One said it was a boggart, an' another he said "Nay;
It's just a ge'man-farmer, that has gone an' lost his way."
                                            Look ye there!

They hunted, an' they hollo'd, an' the next thing they did find
Was a gruntin', grindin' grindlestone, an' that they left behind.
                                            Look ye there!

One said it was a grindlestone, another he said "Nay;
It's nought but an' owd fossil cheese, that somebody's roll't away."
                                            Look ye there!

They hunted, an' they hollo'd, an' the next thing they did find
Was a bull-calf in a pin-fold, an' that, too, they left behind.
                                            Look ye there!

One said it was a bull-calf, an' another he said "Nay;
It's just a painted jackass, that has never larnt to bray."
                                            Look ye there!

[Illustration]

They hunted, an' they hollo'd, an' the next thing they did find
Was a two-three children leaving school, an' these they left behind.
                                            Look ye there!

One said that they were children, but another he said "Nay;
They're no' but little angels, so we'll leave 'em to their play."
                                            Look ye there!

[Illustration]

They hunted, an' they hollo'd, an' the next thing they did find
Was a fat pig smiling in a ditch, an' that, too, they left behind.
                                            Look ye there!

One said it was a fat pig, but another he said "Nay;
It's just a Lunnon Alderman, whose clothes are stole away."
                                            Look ye there!

They hunted, an' they hollo'd, an' the next thing they did find
Was two young lovers in a lane, an' these they left behind.
                                            Look ye there!

One said that they were lovers, but another he said "Nay;
They're two poor wanderin' lunatics--come, let us go away."
                                            Look ye there!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

So they hunted, and they hollo'd, till the setting of the sun;
An' they'd nought to bring away at last, when th' huntin'-day was done.
                                            Look ye there!

Then one unto the other said, "This huntin' doesn't pay;
But we'n powler't up an' down a bit, an' had a rattlin' day."
                                            Look ye there!
