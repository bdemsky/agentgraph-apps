Book 56        Titus

56:001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
           according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging
           of the truth which is after godliness;

56:001:002 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
           before the world began;

56:001:003 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching,
           which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God
           our Saviour;

56:001:004 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
           and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
           Saviour.

56:001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
           in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in
           every city, as I had appointed thee:

56:001:006 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
           children not accused of riot or unruly.

56:001:007 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
           selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not
           given to filthy lucre;

56:001:008 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
           holy, temperate;

56:001:009 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he
           may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
           the gainsayers.

56:001:010 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
           specially they of the circumcision:

56:001:011 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
           teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

56:001:012 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
           Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

56:001:013 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
           may be sound in the faith;

56:001:014 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,
           that turn from the truth.

56:001:015 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
           defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
           and conscience is defiled.

56:001:016 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
           being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
           reprobate.

56:002:001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

56:002:002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
           in charity, in patience.

56:002:003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
           holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
           of good things;

56:002:004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
           husbands, to love their children,

56:002:005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
           their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

56:002:006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

56:002:007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in
           doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

56:002:008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
           contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
           you.

56:002:009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
           please them well in all things; not answering again;

56:002:010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
           adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

56:002:011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
           all men,

56:002:012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
           should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
           world;

56:002:013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
           the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

56:002:014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
           iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
           of good works.

56:002:015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
           Let no man despise thee.

56:003:001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
           to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

56:003:002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
           shewing all meekness unto all men.

56:003:003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
           deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
           and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

56:003:004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
           man appeared,

56:003:005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
           according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
           regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

56:003:006 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
           Saviour;

56:003:007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
           according to the hope of eternal life.

56:003:008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
           affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
           be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
           profitable unto men.

56:003:009 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions,
           and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and
           vain.

56:003:010 A man that is an heretick after the first and second
           admonition reject;

56:003:011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
           condemned of himself.

56:003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
           to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to
           winter.

56:003:013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
           diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

56:003:014 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
           uses, that they be not unfruitful.

56:003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in
           the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
