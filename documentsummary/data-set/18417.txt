              THE GREAT PANJANDRUM

                    HIMSELF

    [Illustration (drawing, pic03trans.gif)]

So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf


    [Illustration (drawing, pic04trans.gif)]

to make


    [Illustration (drawing, pic05trans.gif)]

an apple-pie;


    [Illustration (painting, pic06.jpg)]


    [Illustration (drawing, pic07trans.gif)]

and at the same time a great she-bear,
coming down the street, pops its head
into the shop.


    [Illustration (drawing, pic08trans.gif)]

    [Illustration (drawing, pic13trans.gif)]


    [Illustration (drawing, pic14trans.gif)]

    [Illustration (painting, pic15.jpg)]


    [Illustration (drawing, pic16trans.gif)]

and the Garyulies,


    [Illustration (drawing, pic17trans.gif)]


    [Illustration (drawing, pic18trans.gif)]

and the great Panjandrum himself, with
the little round button at top;


    [Illustration (painting, pic19.jpg)]


    [Illustration (drawing, pic20trans.gif)]


    [Illustration (drawing, pic21trans.gif)]


and they all fell to playing the game of
catch-as-catch-can,

    [Illustration (drawing, pic22trans.gif)]

till the gunpowder ran out at the heels
of their boots.
