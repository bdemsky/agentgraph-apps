QUOTES AND IMAGES FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN.



ABRAHAM LINCOLN



Included here are quotations and references to subjects in the eight
volumes of "The Writings of Abraham Lincoln".  It begins with his first
political address in 1832 and ends with a hastily scrawled note on the
day of his assassination. I hoped that the design of the html page with
quotations scrolling down along the side of various steel engravings and
photographs of this great man might give the words a greater impact.
