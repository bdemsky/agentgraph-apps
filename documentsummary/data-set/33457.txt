TO THE MEMORY
OF
_William Palgrave_, _Esq._


                                 LATE OF
                               COLTISHALL,
                        IN THE COUNTY OF NORFOLK.

   In passing through this vale of tears,
      That various scenes display;
   Ambition oft her standard rears,
      And mortals lead astray.

   The anxious merchant counts his gain
      From vessels on the sea;
   They're lost upon the watery main,
      And all his prospects flee.

   Dejection seize his harrass'd mind,
      While struggling with dispair;
   Dame Fortune smiles and proves more kind,
      His spirits for to cheer.

   Such is man's losses--varied lot,
      To-day he counts his store,
   To-morrow breathless on the spot
      He pac'd the day before.

   Let those who wish thro' life's short span,
      In heaven's path to move;
   Copy the late departed man,
      Whom Death has call'd above.

   Upon his word you might depend,
      Experience prov'd it true;
   He ever was the poor man's friend,
      Before he bade adieu.

   He always would afford relief
      To those who crav'd his aid;
   And felt for those annoy'd by grief
      'Till Nature's debt was paid.

   As Magistrate, impartial steer'd
      His course in such a way,
   As made him honor'd and rever'd,
      Where prudence had her sway.

   Justice he lov'd, to others bore
      That boon, while life remain'd;
   His loss on earth the world deplore,
      Yet trust he has obtain'd

   A place of rest, thro' Jesus' aid,
      Till summon'd to appear
   Before our God--before the blest,
      His sentence for to hear.

   I'll on domestic scenes now dwell
      As husband, ever kind;
   As father, few could him excel,
      And those he's left behind

   Attest it, by their tears sincere,
      Each relative has shed
   Upon the sable gloomy bier,
      Encompass'd round the dead.

   He's fled to where none can return--
      Where heavenly blessings dwell;
   Then waft a tear o'er Palgrave's urn,
      Whene'er you bid farewell.
