Delia's Gone
(Traditional, not Johnny Cash who wrote different lyrics with the same
song title)

Tony shot his Delia on a Friday night
First time that he shot her Lord
She laid down her head and died

Chorus:
Delia's gone one more round
Delia's gone one more round
Delia's gone one more round
Delia's gone

Called for the doctor, doctor come too late
Called for the minister to lay poor Delia straight

Chorus

Delia, Oh Delia, where you been so long
Everybody's asking 'bout poor Delia dead and gone

Chorus

Rubber tired buggy, rubber tired hack
They took poor Delia to the graveyard
They ain't gonna bring her back

Chorus (3x)
