Heave Away
(Traditional)

There's some that's bound for New York Town
And other's is bound for France
Heave away me Johnnies,
Heave away

And some is bound for the Bengal Bay
To teach them whales a dance
And away me Johnnie boys
We're all bound to go

Our pilot is a-waiting for
The turning of the tide
Heave away me Johnnies
Heave away

And one more pull and we're bound away
With a good and westerly wind
And away me Johnnie boys
We're all bound away

Farewell to you dear Kingston gals
Farewell to St. Andrew's Dock
Heave away me Johnnies,
Heave away

If ever we should come back again
We'll make your cradles rock
And away me Johnnie boys
We're all bound away

There's some that's bound for New York Town
And other's is bound for France
Heave away me Johnnies,
Heave away

And some is bound for the Bengal Bay
To teach them whales a dance
And away me Johnnie boys
We're all bound to go.
