[Illustration]

      Bye a baby bunting,
      Daddy's gone a hunting.
      For to buy a rabbit skin
      To wrap up baby bunting in.
      But mamma stays at home, you see
      To play with baby and O. N. T.


[Illustration]

      Hickery, dickery, 6 and 7,
      Hollowbone, crackabone, 10 and 11;
      Spinnery, spannery, musketry,
      Twiddle 'um, twaddle 'um, O. N. T.


[Illustration]

          Multiplication is vexation,
            Division is as bad,
      The Rule of Three doth puzzle me,
        And Fractions make me mad:
      But one of the pleasant things to me,
        Is to handle a needle with O. N. T.


[Illustration]

      Pussy-cat, pussy-cat,
        Where have you been?
      I've been to London
        To look at the queen.
      Pussy-cat, pussy-cat,
        What did you see?
      I saw the queen
        Sewing with O. N. T.

[Illustration]

      Brow brinky, eye winky,
      Chin choppy, nose noppy,
      Cheek cherry, mouth merry,
      Baby's face, as bright can be,
      As she plays with O. N. T.


[Illustration]

      Betty Pringle had a little pig,
      Not very little and not very big;
      When alive he lived in clover,
      But now he's dead, he's dead all over.
      So Billy Pringle he lay down and cried,
      And Betty Pringle she lay down and died;
      So there was an end of one, two and three,
      Billy Pringle he,
      Betty Pringle she,
      And Piggie Wiggee,
      All of which rhymes with our O. N. T.


[Illustration]

      Hip-i-ty hop
        To the barber shop,
      This horse of mine,
        He will not stop.
      I'll buy a spool of cotton,
        One for you,
        And one for me,
      Which shall it be?
        Why, O. N. T.


[Illustration]

              Great A, little a.
              Bouncing B!
      The cat's in the cupboard,
      And she can't see
      That her kittens are playing with O. N. T.
