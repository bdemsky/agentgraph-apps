FCC CHAIR TO WORLDCOM:  NOT SO FAST THERE
A statement by Federal Communications Commission chairman William E. Kennard
indicates that MCI WorldCom may have some difficulty getting FCC approval of
its $129-billion acquisition of Sprint:  "Competition has produced a price
war in the long-distance market. This merger appears to be a surrender. How
can this be good for customers? The parties will bear a heavy burden to show
how consumers would be better off." (Washington Post 6 Oct 99)
