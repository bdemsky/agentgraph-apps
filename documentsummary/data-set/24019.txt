A stencil-plate, that read complete--"SAPOLIO."

And through them hissed the words, "Well, blow
Me tight if here is 'ary show!" "SAPOLIO."

Pray give us! What with 'Bixby's Best,'

One Sabbath morn, as heavenward

Shameless, but vigorous, he sat,
While on their luggage as they passed,
He checked that word, from first to last, "SAPOLIO."
