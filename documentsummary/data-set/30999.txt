 A New Chipmunk (Genus Eutamias) from
 the Black Hills

 BY
 JOHN A. WHITE


Study of the chipmunks from the eastern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains
reveals that the chipmunks from northeastern Wyoming and from South
Dakota which Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:55, November 30, 1929) referred
to _Eutamias minimus borealis_ actually belong to a heretofore unnamed
subspecies which may be named and described as follows:


#Eutamias minimus silvaticus# new subspecies

     _Type._--Female, adult, skull and skin, No. 20050 Mus. Nat. Hist.,
     Univ. Kansas; from 3 mi. NW Sundance, 5900 ft., Crook County,
     Wyoming; obtained on July 4, 1947, by H. W. Setzer; original No.
     1692.

     _Range._--Bear Lodge Mountains in northeastern Wyoming and the
     Black Hills of South Dakota.

     _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); general tone of
     upper parts drab; sides Ochraceous Buff (capitalized terms are of
     Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,
     1912); lateral stripes Fuscus Black washed with Ochraceous Tawny;
     ventral side of tail near (14' _h_) Ochraceous Orange and fringed
     with black.

     _Comparisons._--From _Eutamias minimus pallidus_ (specimens from
     Buffalo in Johnson County, Ivy Creek, Rockypoint, Middle Butte, and
     South Butte in Campbell County, all in Wyoming, and Harrison, Sioux
     County, Nebraska), the subspecies to the southward, westward, and
     northward, _E. m. silvaticus_ differs in: General tone of upper
     parts markedly darker, more reddish and less grayish; dorsal
     stripes darker; crown markedly darker. External measurements, and
     measurements and characters of the skull of the two subspecies,
     do not differ significantly. Unless otherwise specified all
     comparative material is in the Museum of Natural History of the
     University of Kansas.

     From _Eutamias minimus cacodemus_ (topotypes in the United States
     National Museum), the subspecies to the southeastward, _E. m.
     silvaticus_ differs in the same manner in which it differs from _E.
     m. pallidus_, but the degree of difference is greater because _E.
     m. cacodemus_ is even paler than _E. m. pallidus_.

     From _Eutamias minimus confinis_ (specimens from 17-1/2 mi. E and
     4-1/2 mi. S Shell, 8500 ft., Big Horn County, Wyoming), _E. m.
     silvaticus_ differs in: General tone of upper parts darker, more
     reddish and less grayish; sides of rump more reddish and less
     grayish; underside of tail more tawny; skull distinctly longer
     and broader across zygomata.

     From _Eutamias minimus borealis_ (specimens from 1 mi. NW of
     junction of Irons Creek and Laird River; N side Muskwa River, 4 mi.
     W Ft. Nelson, 1200 ft.; E side Minaker River, 1 mi. W Trutch;
     Beatton River, 115 mi. S Ft. Nelson; 5 mi. W and 3 mi. N Ft. St.
     John; S side Toad River, 10 mi. S and 21 mi. E Muncho Lake; all in
     British Columbia; and from Assineau River, 1920 ft., 10 mi. E and 1
     mi. N Kinuso, Alberta), _E. m. silvaticus_ differs in: Under side
     of tail more reddish; dorsal stripes less blackish; sides slightly
     paler (less tawny); nasals distinctly shorter; skull distinctly
     shorter.

     _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of three adult
     males and 11 adult females of _E. m. silvaticus_ from the type
     locality are, respectively, as follows: Total length, 190
     (189-190), 207 (202-220); length of tail, 85 (81-90), 97 (82-105);
     length of hind foot, 31 (30-33), 32 (31-34); length of ear, 14
     (13-16), 15 (14-17); weight, 45.7 (44.6-46.5), 55.7 (50.0-68.0);
     greatest length of skull, 32.0 (31.5-32.6), 32.3 (31.5-33.1);
     zygomatic breadth, 18.5 (18.5-18.5), 18.6 (18.2-19.0); least
     interorbital constriction, 6.9 (6.8-7.1), 7.0 (6.4-8.1); length of
     nasals, 9.4 (9.2-9.6), 9.6 (9.3-10.1).

     _Measurements of the type._--Total length, 206; length of tail, 90;
     length of hind foot, 32; length of ear, 15; weight, 59.3; greatest
     length of skull, 32.6; zygomatic breadth, 18.6; least interorbital
     constriction, 6.4; length of nasals, 9.3.

     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 28. Specimens from South
     Dakota are in the United States National Museum, and those from
     Wyoming are in the Museum of Natural History of the University of
     Kansas.

     #South Dakota#: _Custer Co._: Custer, 3; _Lawrence Co._: Deadwood,
     10.

     #Wyoming#: _Crook County_: 3 mi. NW Sundance, 5900 ft., 14; 15 mi.
     ENE Sundance, 3825 ft., 1.

     Acknowledgment is made of assistance, with the field work, received
     from the Kansas University Endowment Association.
