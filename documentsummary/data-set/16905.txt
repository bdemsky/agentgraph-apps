Many years ago, and many miles away, there was a little Prince who was
exactly like the Lord Chamberlain's son, and sometimes even the artful
old Chamberlain himself could not tell one from the other.

When the Prince became King of Noware, they were still alike as two
peas, and one day, when they were playing in the garden, a Magic Bush
suddenly grew up behind the King. At the same moment the Chamberlain's
Son suddenly lost his temper,

And pushed his royal play-fellow into the Magic Bush. The little
King was immediately changed into a strange red Frog, which ran
away croaking fearfully.


[Illustration]


The wicked Chamberlain seemed quite pleased when his son told him what
had happened,

[Illustration]


And, placing a crown on his own son's head, he said, "Your Majesty has
made a mistake; how can the King be a Frog when I see your Majesty
before me?" And they both smiled artfully.


[Illustration]


The Chamberlain pretended to weep, and told everybody that his Son had
been turned into a Frog.


[Illustration]


So the false King sat on the throne and grew up to be very bad and ugly,
because he was always afraid the real King would return. He heard of
the wonderful King of the Frogs, who carried off cattle on his back,
and every time he saw a Frog he shivered all over.


[Illustration]


He was going to marry the Princess of Sumwareruther, and they expected
her day after day, but she did not come. At last they became quite
anxious, when one morning a little Blue Dwarf arrived at the Palace.
He was quite breathless.


[Illustration]


His name was Omolo, and he told the King that when he and the young
Princess (he was the Princess's page) were about twenty miles from the
Palace, a Great Red Frog suddenly confronted them, put the soldiers to
flight, and carried off the Princess.


[Illustration]


The King flew into a rage, and rushed out of the room declaring that
he would go to war with the King of the Frogs.


[Illustration]


So the Chamberlain made a speech to the Army.


[Illustration]


But the Army was so afraid of the Great Red Frog that they were taken
ill and could not go.


[Illustration]


And without saying a word to anyone, little Omolo climbed on to a
Stork's back--


[Illustration]


And flew off to save the Princess.


[Illustration]


Now the Stork had a friend, a very wise Owl, to whom they went for
advice. The Owl put on his glasses and a very grave voice. He told Omolo
where he would find a Magic Sword, and also where the King of the Frogs
lived.


[Illustration]


Then, after thanking the Owl, they went on again and finally found the
King Frog at home; but Omolo was rather surprised to see the Princess
taking afternoon tea with him, and not frightened in the least.


[Illustration]


When she saw Omolo, she clapped her hands with delight, but before she
could say a word, he attacked the King of the Frogs with his Magic Sword
and wounded him. Directly the Sword touched the Frog,--


[Illustration]


He changed into a splendid King with a Ruby Crown. The Princess was
delighted, for, as of course you have guessed, he was the real King
of Noware.


[Illustration]


He thanked Omolo graciously, and, taking the Magic Sword, he changed
the little Blue Dwarf into a handsome fellow, and made him an Earl on
the spot, and gave him command of the Army.


[Illustration]


And being very pleased with the kind Stork he changed him into a man,
and made him his Chancellor. He was a bit storky at first, but he
gradually improved.


[Illustration]


Thoughtfully leaving the King and the Princess to talk things over, Earl
Omolo went out and caught a Robin, changed it into a smart soldier, and
sent him off recruiting. Very shortly there were thousands of Robins
twittering to be enlisted.


[Illustration]


They marched back to the Palace with a large army, and everybody was
pleased to see them, except the false King and the Chamberlain, who
begged the King to spare their lives, and as he was very happy he did
so. But they were justly punished.


[Illustration]


So the King married the Princess, and they had a magnificent Coronation,
and as everybody was happy at the end--I hope you will be happy at

                                THE END.
