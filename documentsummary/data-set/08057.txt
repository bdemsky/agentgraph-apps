Book 57        Philemon

57:001:001 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother,
           unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

57:001:002 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
           and to the church in thy house:

57:001:003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
           Jesus Christ.

57:001:004 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

57:001:005 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
           Jesus, and toward all saints;

57:001:006 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
           the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in
           Christ Jesus.

57:001:007 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
           bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

57:001:008 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
           thee that which is convenient,

57:001:009 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one
           as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

57:001:010 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
           bonds:

57:001:011 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
           profitable to thee and to me:

57:001:012 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
           mine own bowels:

57:001:013 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might
           have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

57:001:014 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
           should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

57:001:015 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
           shouldest receive him for ever;

57:001:016 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
           specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the
           flesh, and in the Lord?

57:001:017 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

57:001:018 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
           account;

57:001:019 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
           albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine
           own self besides.

57:001:020 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
           bowels in the Lord.

57:001:021 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
           that thou wilt also do more than I say.

57:001:022 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
           your prayers I shall be given unto you.

57:001:023 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

57:001:024 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

57:001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
