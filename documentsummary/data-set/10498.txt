Ain' No Mo' Cane On De Brazis
(Southern Chain Gang Song)

It ain' no mo' cane on de Brazis
Oh...Oh, Oh
Done groun' it all in molazzis,
Oh...Oh, Oh

B'lieve I'll do like ol' Riley,
Ol' Riley walked de Brazis.

One o' dese mornin's an' it won' be long,
You gonna call me an' I'll be gone.

Oughta come on de river in nineteen-O-fo',
You could fin' a dead man in every turn row.

Oughta come on de river in nineteen an' ten,
Dey was drivin' de women jes' like de men.

I looked at my Ol' Hannah an' she's turnin' red,
I looked at my podner an' he's almos' dead.

Well, I wonder what's de matter, somepin' mus' be wrong
W're still I here rollin', Shorty George done gone.

Go Down, Ol' Hannah, doncha rise no mo',
Ef you rise any mo' bring judgement day.

It ain' no mo' cane on de Brazis
Done groun' it all in molazzis.
