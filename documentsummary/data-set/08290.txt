Book 63 2 John
001:001 The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth;
        and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;
001:002 for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be
        with us forever:
001:003 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father,
        and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father,
        in truth and love.
001:004 I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking
        in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.
001:005 Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you
        a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning,
        that we love one another.
001:006 This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments.
        This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning,
        that you should walk in it.
001:007 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who
        don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh.
        This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.
001:008 Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we
        have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.
001:009 Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in the teaching
        of Christ, doesn't have God.  He who remains in the teaching,
        the same has both the Father and the Son.
001:010 If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching,
        don't receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,
001:011 for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.
001:012 Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so with paper
        and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face,
        that our joy may be made full.
001:013 The children of your chosen sister greet you.  Amen.
