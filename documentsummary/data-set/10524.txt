We Wish You a Merry Christmas
(English Traditional, 16th Century)

We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year.

Oh bring us some figgy pudding (3x)
With a cup of good cheer.

We won't go until we get it (3x)

We all love our figgy pudding (3x)

With a cup of good cheer
So bring it out here!

We wish you a merry Christmas (3x)
And a happy New Year.
