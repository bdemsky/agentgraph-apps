             Tadarida femorosacca (Merriam) In Tamaulipas,
                                 Mexico

    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map showing localities of known occurrence
       of the pocketed free-tailed bat (_Tadarida femorosacca_).]

On January 23, 1946, two pocketed free-tailed bats (_Tadarida
femorosacca_, Catalogue nos. 17852 and 17853) were obtained in a large
cave 10 kilometers north-northeast of the village of Antiguo Morelos, in
the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. This extends the known range of this
species to the Atlantic Slope and more than 300 miles to the northeast
of Zacoalco, Jalisco, the only locality in central Mexico from which the
species was previously known (see Shamel, H. H., Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus.,
vol. 78, art. 19, p. 13, 1931). The total length of the skull (18 mm.)
and the basal length (15.0, 15.2) are less than recorded by Shamel
(_op. cit._) for any one of the eight specimens studied by him.
Otherwise our two specimens answer the description of _femorosacca_.
They were found lying on the floor of the cave. One was dead and the
other alive but incapable of flight. Shooting into the cracks of the
roof of the cave more than a hundred feet high failed to dislodge other
bats but stimulated a volume of squeaking of bats which indicated that
thousands of individuals, possibly of this species, were ensconsed
there. The cave had long been used by bats as attested by the large
deposit of guano, much of which had been removed for fertilizer.
