 A New Bat (Genus Pipistrellus)
 from Northeastern Mexico

 by
 Rollin H. Baker


The eastern pipistrelle, _Pipistrellus subflavus_ (Cuvier) in the
western part of its range, occurs along the Rio Grande and its
tributaries as far west as northern Coahuila and Val Verde County,
Texas. Specimens from those places represent a heretofore undescribed
subspecies which may be named and described as follows:

#Pipistrellus subflavus clarus new subspecies#

     _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 48270, Univ. Kansas
     Mus. Nat. Hist.; 2 mi. W Jimenez, el. 850 ft., Coahuila; 19 June
     1952; obtained by Rollin H. Baker, original No. 2062.

     _Range._--Known from northern Coahuila and adjacent parts of
     southwestern Texas.

     _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); upper parts pale, near
     (_c_) Cinnamon-Buff (capitalized color term after Ridgway, Color
     Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912); skull
     large; zygomata expanded laterally.

     _Comparisons._--Compared with _Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus_
     (specimens from Marshall Hall in Maryland, Raleigh in North
     Carolina, and Barber County in Kansas) _P. s. clarus_ is paler,
     of approximately equal size, and has the zygomata slightly more
     expanded laterally. From _Pipistrellus subflavus veracrucis_
     (Ward), specimens from 4 km. E Las Vigas, el. 8500 ft., Veracruz,
     _P. s. clarus_ differs in being larger, paler, and in having a
     larger skull.

_Remarks._--_Pipistrellus subflavus clarus_ is the palest subspecies of
the eastern pipistrelle. Of the specimens assigned to _clarus_ (all
taken in May and June), only two are sufficiently dark to compare
favorably with examples of typical _subflavus_. A specimen (KU 60296)
assigned to _P. s. subflavus_ from Rancho Pano Ayuctle, el. 300 ft., 6
mi. N Gomez Farias, Tamaulipas, is much darker than _clarus_. A specimen
recorded from Devils River, Texas, by V. Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 25:211,
October 24, 1905) has not been examined by me but presumably is _P. s.
clarus_.

_Pipistrellus subflavus clarus_ was taken along the Rio San Diego and
the Rio Sabinas, both tributaries of the Rio Grande, where park-like
stands of pecan, cypress, willow and other trees bordered these streams.
The species was not found at stock ponds or along stream courses in
adjacent places where such trees were absent. Funds for financing field
work were made available by the Kansas University Endowment Association
and the National Science Foundation.

     _Measurements._--Measurements of the holotype and average and
     extreme measurements of 5 adult females from the type locality,
     including the holotype, are, respectively, as follows: Total
     length, 85, 88.0 (85-92); length of tail vertebrae, 43, 40.8
     (36-45); length of hind foot, 9, 9.4 (8.5-11); height of ear from
     notch, 12, 12.6 (12-13); length of forearm, 33.8, 33.4 (32.9-33.8);
     length of tibia, 14.8, 14.6 (14.5-14.8); greatest length of
     skull, 13.3, 13.1 (12.7-13.3); condylobasal length, 12.6, 12.4
     (12.1-12.6); breadth of braincase, 7.0, 6.8 (6.7-7.0); zygomatic
     breadth, 8.1, 8.0 (7.8-8.2); mastoid breadth, 7.1, 6.9 (6.5-7.1);
     length maxillary tooth-row, 4.5, 4.5 (4.4-4.6).

     _Specimens examined._--Those from Texas are in the collection of
     the United States National Museum, and those from Coahuila are in
     University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Total, 21. TEXAS:
     Comstock, 1; Del Rio, 2. COAHUILA: 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., 15; 2
     mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas, 1160 ft., 3.
