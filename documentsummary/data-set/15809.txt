PUBLISHER'S NOTE

Kate Greenaway used an early version of the rhyme to illustrate
A APPLE PIE which was first published in 1886 and it will be noticed
that there is no rhyme for the letter I.

The rhyme of A APPLE PIE is very ancient and reference is made to it as
early as 1671 in one of the writings of John Eachard. In these early
versions the letters I and J were not differentiated. The letter J as we
know it to-day was the curved initial form of the letter I and was always
used before a vowel.
