Transcript of Arthur Sullivan's message to Edison upon introduction to the
phonograph:

...For myself, I can only say that I am astonished and somewhat terrified
at the result of this evening's experiment--astonished at the wonderful
power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so much hideous
and bad music may be put on record forever.  But all the same, I think it
is the most wonderful thing that I have ever experienced, and I congratulate
you with all my heart on this wonderful discovery.
