I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
(Lyrics: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow)
(Composer: John Baptiste Calkin, music originally "Waltham")

I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play.
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on Earth, good will to men.

I thought how, as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along th' unbroken song
Of peace on Earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head
"There is no peace on Earth," I said,
"For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on Earth, good will to men."

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
"God is not dead, nor doth He slee;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on Earth, good will to men."

Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on Earth, good will to men.
