The Pasture

   The cows are eating.
   They like green grass.
   The sun is shining.
   Cows need sunshine.
   They give milk every day.
   It is milk for you and me.

   This is a clean barn.
   The cows are clean, too.
   The man has clean hands.
   The milking machine is clean.
   The milk will be clean.
