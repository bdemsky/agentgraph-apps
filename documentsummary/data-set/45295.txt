TOM, THE PIPER'S SON.


|Tom, he was a piper's son,

`He learn'd to play when he was

```young;

`The only tune that he could play

`Was Over the hills and far away.=



`Tom, Tom, the piper's son,

``Stole a pig, and away he run;



[Illustration: 0004]

`The pig was eat Tom was beat,

``And Tom ran roaring down

```the street.=



`Here is a long tailed pig, or a

```short tailed pig, all sorts of

```pigs for sale:

`A boar pig, or a sow pig, or a

```pig with a curly tail.=



[Illustration: 005]

`All the little girls and boys

``Were so delighted with his

```noise,

`They'd dance and sing, while he

```did play

``Over the hills and far away.=



`Tom now learn'd another tune,

``"The cow that jumped o'er the

```moon."

[Illustration: 0006]

`It made the horned cattle prance,

``And caused the sleepy pigs to

```dance.=



`Tom saw a donkey pass along,

`Then played a little merry song;

`The donkey danc'd about the

```road,

`And soon was lighten'd of his

```load.=

`Tom, next met a pretty lass,

``Tending cows upon the grass

`He tuned his pipe, which caused

```much fun.=



`The cow, she danced, the maid

```she run.

`Dame Trot went out to sell her

```eggs.

`He used his pipe, and she her legs

[Illustration: 0008]

`Her eggs were very sadly broke,

``While wicked Tom enjoy'd

```the joke.=



`Tom met the parson on his way,

``Took out his pipe, began to

```play,

`A merry tune, that led his grace

``Into a very dirty place.=



[Illustration: 0009]

`The mayor then said, he would

```not fail

``To send poor Tommy off to jail

`Tom took his pipe, began to play,

``And all the court soon danc'd

```away.=



`'Twas quite a treat to see the rout

``How clerks and judges hop-

```ped about.=



[Illustration: 0010]

`Policeman Grab, who held him

```fast,

``Began to dance about at last;

`Whilst Tom delighted at the

```fun,

``Slipped out of court, and off

```did run.=



````Finis.
