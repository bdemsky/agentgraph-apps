Book 36 Zephaniah
001:001 The word of Yahweh which came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi,
        the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah,
        in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.
001:002 I will utterly sweep away everything off of the surface
        of the earth, says Yahweh.
001:003 I will sweep away man and animal.  I will sweep away the birds
        of the sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps of rubble
        with the wicked.  I will cut off man from the surface
        of the earth, says Yahweh.
001:004 I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all
        the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  I will cut off the remnant of Baal
        from this place:  the name of the idolatrous and pagan priests,
001:005 those who worship the army of the sky on the housetops,
        those who worship and swear by Yahweh and also swear by Malcam,
001:006 those who have turned back from following Yahweh, and those
        who haven't sought Yahweh nor inquired after him.
001:007 Be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh, for the day
        of Yahweh is at hand.  For Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice.
        He has consecrated his guests.
001:008 It will happen in the day of Yahweh's sacrifice, that I will
        punish the princes, the king's sons, and all those who are
        clothed with foreign clothing.
001:009 In that day, I will punish all those who leap over the threshold,
        who fill their master's house with violence and deceit.
001:010 In that day, says Yahweh, there will be the noise of a cry
        from the fish gate, a wailing from the second quarter,
        and a great crashing from the hills.
001:011 Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan
        are undone!  All those who were loaded with silver are cut off.
001:012 It will happen at that time, that I will search Jerusalem
        with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on
        their dregs, who say in their heart, "Yahweh will not do good,
        neither will he do evil."
001:013 Their wealth will become a spoil, and their houses a desolation.
        Yes, they will build houses, but won't inhabit them.
        They will plant vineyards, but won't drink their wine.
001:014 The great day of Yahweh is near.  It is near,
        and hurries greatly, the voice of the day of Yahweh.
        The mighty man cries there bitterly.
001:015 That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish,
        a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom,
        a day of clouds and blackness,
001:016 a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities,
        and against the high battlements.
001:017 I will bring distress on men, that they will walk like blind men,
        because they have sinned against Yahweh, and their blood
        will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.
001:018 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver
        them in the day of Yahweh's wrath, but the whole land will
        be devoured by the fire of his jealousy; for he will make
        an end, yes, a terrible end, of all those who dwell in the land.
002:001 Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, you nation
        that has no shame,
002:002 before the appointed time when the day passes as the chaff,
        before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you, before the day
        of Yahweh's anger comes on you.
002:003 Seek Yahweh, all you humble of the land, who have kept
        his ordinances.  Seek righteousness.  Seek humility.
        It may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh's anger.
002:004 For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation.
        They will drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron will
        be rooted up.
002:005 Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation
        of the Cherethites!  The word of Yahweh is against you,
        Canaan, the land of the Philistines.  I will destroy you,
        that there will be no inhabitant.
002:006 The sea coast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds
        and folds for flocks.
002:007 The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah.
        They will find pasture.  In the houses of Ashkelon,
        they will lie down in the evening, for Yahweh, their God,
        will visit them, and restore them.
002:008 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the
        children of Ammon, with which they have reproached my people,
        and magnified themselves against their border.
002:009 Therefore as I live, says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel,
        surely Moab will be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah,
        a possession of nettles, and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation.
        The remnant of my people will plunder them, and the survivors
        of my nation will inherit them.
002:010 This they will have for their pride, because they have reproached
        and magnified themselves against the people of Yahweh of Armies.
002:011 Yahweh will be awesome to them, for he will famish all the gods
        of the land.  Men will worship him, everyone from his place,
        even all the shores of the nations.
002:012 You Cushites also, you will be killed by my sword.
002:013 He will stretch out his hand against the north, destroy Assyria,
        and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.
002:014 Herds will lie down in the midst of her, all the animals
        of the nations.  Both the pelican and the porcupine will lodge
        in its capitals.  Their calls will echo through the windows.
        Desolation will be in the thresholds, for he has laid bare
        the cedar beams.
002:015 This is the joyous city that lived carelessly, that said
        in her heart, "I am, and there is none besides me."
        How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down in!
        Everyone who passes by her will hiss, and shake their fists.
003:001 Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!
003:002 She didn't obey the voice.  She didn't receive correction.
        She didn't trust in Yahweh.  She didn't draw near to her God.
003:003 Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions.
        Her judges are evening wolves.  They leave nothing until
        the next day.
003:004 Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people.
        Her priests have profaned the sanctuary.  They have done
        violence to the law.
003:005 Yahweh, in the midst of her, is righteous.  He will do no wrong.
        Every morning he brings his justice to light.  He doesn't fail,
        but the unjust know no shame.
003:006 I have cut off nations.  Their battlements are desolate.
        I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by.
        Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man,
        so that there is no inhabitant.
003:007 I said, "Just fear me.  Receive correction, so that her dwelling won't
        be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her."
        But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.
003:008 "Therefore wait for me," says Yahweh, "until the day that I rise
        up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations,
        that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation,
        even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured
        with the fire of my jealousy.
003:009 For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all
        call on the name of Yahweh, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.
003:010 From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter
        of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.
003:011 In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings,
        in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will
        take away out of the midst of you your proudly exulting ones,
        and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain.
003:012 But I will leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people,
        and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh.
003:013 The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies,
        neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they
        will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid."
003:014 Sing, daughter of Zion!  Shout, Israel!  Be glad and rejoice
        with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.
003:015 Yahweh has taken away your judgments.  He has thrown out your enemy.
        The King of Israel, Yahweh, is in the midst of you.
        You will not be afraid of evil any more.
003:016 In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, "Don't be afraid, Zion.
        Don't let your hands be slack."
003:017 Yahweh, your God, is in the midst of you, a mighty one who will save.
        He will rejoice over you with joy.  He will rest in his love.
        He will rejoice over you with singing.
003:018 Those who are sad for the appointed feasts, I will remove from you.
        They are a burden and a reproach to you.
003:019 Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you,
        and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were
        driven away.  I will give them praise and honor, whose shame
        has been in all the earth.
003:020 At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I
        gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all
        the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity
        before your eyes, says Yahweh.
