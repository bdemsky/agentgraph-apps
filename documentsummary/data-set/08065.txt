Book 65        Jude

65:001:001 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
           them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
           Jesus Christ, and called:

65:001:002 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

65:001:003 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
           common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
           exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith
           which was once delivered unto the saints.

65:001:004 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before
           of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
           grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only
           Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

65:001:005 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
           this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the
           land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

65:001:006 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
           their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
           under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

65:001:007 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
           manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
           strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the
           vengeance of eternal fire.

65:001:008 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
           dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

65:001:009 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
           disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him
           a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

65:001:010 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
           what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
           they corrupt themselves.

65:001:011 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
           greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in
           the gainsaying of Core.

65:001:012 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
           with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are
           without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit
           withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

65:001:013 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
           wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness
           for ever.

65:001:014 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
           saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his
           saints,

65:001:015 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
           ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have
           ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which
           ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

65:001:016 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
           lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having
           men's persons in admiration because of advantage.

65:001:017 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
           of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

65:001:018 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
           time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

65:001:019 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
           Spirit.

65:001:020 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
           faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

65:001:021 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of
           our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

65:001:022 And of some have compassion, making a difference:

65:001:023 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;
           hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

65:001:024 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
           present you faultless before the presence of his glory with
           exceeding joy,

65:001:025 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
           dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
