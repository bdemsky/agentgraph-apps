	  "We talked of pipe-clay regulation caps
    Long twenty-foursshort culverins and mortars
Condemn'd the 'Horse Guards' for a set of raps,
    And cursed our fate at being in such quarters.
Some smoked, some sighed, and some were heard to snore;
    Some wished themselves five fathoms 'neat the Solway;
And some did praywho never prayed before
    That they might get the 'route' for Cork or Galway."
