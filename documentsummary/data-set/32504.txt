ALL ABOUT THE THREE LITTLE PIGS


[Illustration]

Once upon a time there was an old pig with three little pigs, and,
as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their
fortunes.

[Illustration]

The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to
him, "Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house;" which the
man did, and the little pig built a house with it.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Presently a wolf came along and knocked at the door, and said, "Little
pig, little pig, let me come in!"

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

To which the pig answered, "No, no, by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"

This made the wolf angry, and he said, "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff,
and I'll blow your house in!"

So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the
little pig.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The second little pig met a man who was chopping wood, and said,
"Please, man, give me some of that wood to build me a house;" which
the man did, and the pig built his house with it.

[Illustration]

Then along came the wolf, and said:

"Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"

"No, no, by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"

"Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!"

[Illustration]

So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last
he blew the house down and then ate up the little pig.

The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said, "Please,
man, give me those bricks to build a house with;" so the man gave him
the bricks, and he built his house with them.

[Illustration]

Then the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said,
"Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"

"No, no, by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."

Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and puffed, and he puffed
and huffed; but he could not get the house down.

[Illustration]

When he found that he could not with all his huffing and puffing, blow
the house down, he said, "Little pig, I know where there is a nice field
of turnips."

[Illustration]

"Where?" said the little pig.

[Illustration]

"Oh, in Mr. Smith's homefield, and if you will be ready to-morrow
morning, I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some
for dinner."

[Illustration]

"Very well," said the little pig, "I will be ready. What time do you
mean to go?"

"Oh, at six o'clock."

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf
came--which he did about six--and said, "Little pig, are you ready?"

The little pig said, "Ready! I have been, and come back again, and got
a nice potful for dinner!"

[Illustration]

The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought he would be up to the
little pig somehow or other, so he said, "Little pig, I know where there
is a nice pear tree."

"Where?" said the pig.

"Down at Merry-Garden," replied the wolf, "and if you will not deceive
me, I will come for you at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go
together and get some pears."

[Illustration]

Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o'clock, and
went off for the pears, hoping to get back before the wolf came.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

But he had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that, just as
he was getting down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may
suppose, frightened him very much.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

When the wolf came up he said, "What! are you here before me? Are they
nice pears?"

[Illustration]

"Yes, very," said the little pig. "I will throw you down one;" and he
threw it so far that, while the wolf was going to pick it up, the little
pig jumped down and ran home.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig, "Little
pig, there is a Fair at Shanklin this afternoon; will you go?"

"Oh, yes," said the pig, "I will be glad to go; what time will you be
ready?"

"At three," said the wolf.

[Illustration]

So the little pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the
Fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was taking home when he saw
the wolf coming.

[Illustration]

Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and
by doing so turned it over, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in
it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to
the fair.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

He went to the little pig's house, and told him how he had been
frightened by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.
Then the little pig said, "Ha! I frightened you then. I had been to
the Fair and bought a butter-churn, and when I saw you I got into it
and rolled down the hill."

[Illustration]

Then the wolf was very angry, indeed, and declared he would eat up
the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.

[Illustration]

When the little pig saw what he was about, he hung on a pot full of
water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming
down, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf! So the little pig put
on the cover again in an instant, boiled up the wolf, and ate him for
supper, and lived happy forever afterwards.

The End.
