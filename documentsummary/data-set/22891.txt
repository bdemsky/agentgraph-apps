    [Illustration: Simon and the Pieman.]

    Simple Simon met a pieman,
      Going to the fair.
    Says Simple Simon to the pieman
      "Let me taste your ware."

    Says the pieman to Simple Simon,
      "Show me first your penny."
    Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
      "Indeed, I have not any."

    [Illustration: Simon Looking for Plums.]

    Simple Simon went to look
      If plums grew on a thistle,
    He pricked his fingers very much,
      Which made poor Simon whistle.

    Simple Simon went a-fishing,
      For to catch a Whale;
    All the water he had got,
      Was in his mother's pail.

    [Illustration: Simon Hunting.]

    Then Simple Simon went a-hunting,
      For to catch a hare;
    He rode on a goat about the street,
      But could not find one there.

    He went for water in a sieve
      But soon it all run through;

    [Illustration: Ding Dong Bell.]

          Ding, dong, bell,
          Pussy's in the well!
          Who put her in?
          Little Tommy Lin:
          Who pulled her out?
          Little Tommy Stout.
    What a naughty boy was that,
    Who tried to drown poor pussy cat,
    That never did him any harm,
    But killed the mice in his father's barn!




    [Illustration: Little Miss Muffett.]

        Little Miss Muffett,
        She sat on a tuffet
    Eating of curds and whey;
        There came a great spider,
        Who sat down beside her,
    And frightened Miss Muffett away.




    [Illustration: Ride a Cock Horse.]

    Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross,
    To see an old lady upon a white horse;
    Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes,
    And so she makes music wherever she goes.




    [Illustration: Tom Tom the Piper's Son.]

    Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
    Stole a pig and away he run.
      The pig was eat
      And Tom was beat,
    And Tom ran crying down the street.




    [Illustration: Little Bo-peep.]

    Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,
      And can't tell where to find them;
    Let them alone, and they'll come home,
      And bring their tails behind them.

    Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,
      And dream'd she heard them bleating;
    But when she awoke she found it a joke,--
      Her little heart was breaking.

    Then up she took her little crook,
      Determined for to find them;
    She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
      For they'd left their tails behind them.

    It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray
      Into a meadow hard by,
    There she espied their tails side by side.
      All hung on a tree to dry.




    [Illustration: Early to Bed.]

    Early to bed and early to rise,
    Is the way to be healthy, and wealthy and wise.
