Book 34 Nahum
001:001 An oracle about Nineveh.  The book of the vision of
        Nahum the Elkoshite.
001:002 Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges.  Yahweh avenges and is
        full of wrath.  Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries,
        and he maintains wrath against his enemies.
001:003 Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no
        means leave the guilty unpunished.  Yahweh has his way in
        the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust
        of his feet.
001:004 He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers.
        Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes.
001:005 The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away.
        The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and all
        who dwell in it.
001:006 Who can stand before his indignation?  Who can endure the
        fierceness of his anger?  His wrath is poured out like fire,
        and the rocks are broken apart by him.
001:007 Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble;
        and he knows those who take refuge in him.
001:008 But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place,
        and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
001:009 What do you plot against Yahweh?  He will make a full end.
        Affliction won't rise up the second time.
001:010 For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink,
        they are consumed utterly like dry stubble.
001:011 There is one gone forth out of you, who devises evil against Yahweh,
        who counsels wickedness.
001:012 Thus says Yahweh:  "Though they be in full strength, and likewise
        many, even so they will be cut down, and he shall pass away.
        Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
001:013 Now will I break his yoke from off you, and will burst
        your bonds apart."
001:014 Yahweh has commanded concerning you:  "No more descendants
        will bear your name.  Out of the house of your gods,
        will I cut off the engraved image and the molten image.
        I will make your grave, for you are vile."
001:015 Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news,
        who publishes peace!  Keep your feasts, Judah!  Perform your vows,
        for the wicked one will no more pass through you.
        He is utterly cut off.
002:001 He who dashes in pieces has come up against you.
        Keep the fortress!  Watch the way!  Strengthen your waist!
        Fortify your power mightily!
002:002 For Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency
        of Israel; for the destroyers have destroyed them, and ruined
        their vine branches.
002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red.  The valiant men
        are in scarlet.  The chariots flash with steel in the day
        of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished.
002:004 The chariots rage in the streets.  They rush back and forth
        in the broad ways.  Their appearance is like torches.
        They run like the lightnings.
002:005 He summons his picked troops.  They stumble on their way.
        They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in place.
002:006 The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
002:007 It is decreed:  she is uncovered, she is carried away;
        and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves,
        beating on their breasts.
002:008 But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water, yet they
        flee away.  "Stop!  Stop!" they cry, but no one looks back.
002:009 Take the spoil of silver.  Take the spoil of gold, for there
        is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
002:010 She is empty, void, and waste.  The heart melts, the knees
        knock together, their bodies and faces have grown pale.
002:011 Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place
        of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked,
        the lion's cubs, and no one made them afraid?
002:012 The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangled
        for his lionesses, and filled his caves with the kill,
        and his dens with prey.
002:013 "Behold, I am against you," says Yahweh of Armies, "and I
        will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour
        your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the earth,
        and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard."
003:001 Woe to the bloody city!  It is all full of lies and robbery.
        The prey doesn't depart.
003:002 The noise of the whip, the noise of the rattling of wheels,
        prancing horses, and bounding chariots,
003:003 the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, the glittering spear,
        and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses,
        and there is no end of the bodies.  They stumble on their bodies,
003:004 because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring
        prostitute, the mistress of witchcraft, who sells nations
        through her prostitution, and families through her witchcraft.
003:005 "Behold, I am against you," says Yahweh of Armies, "and I
        will lift your skirts over your face.  I will show the nations
        your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.
003:006 I will throw abominable filth on you, and make you vile,
        and will set you a spectacle.
003:007 It will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you,
        and say, 'Nineveh is laid waste!  Who will mourn for her?'
        Where will I seek comforters for you?"
003:008 Are you better than No-Amon,{or, Thebes} who was situated among
        the rivers, who had the waters around her; whose rampart
        was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?
003:009 Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength.  Put and Libya
        were her helpers.
003:010 Yet was she carried away.  She went into captivity.
        Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head
        of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honorable men,
        and all her great men were bound in chains.
003:011 You also will be drunken.  You will be hidden.  You also will
        seek a stronghold because of the enemy.
003:012 All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first-ripe figs:
        if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
003:013 Behold, your troops in your midst are women.
        The gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies.
        The fire has devoured your bars.
003:014 Draw water for the siege.  Strengthen your fortresses.
        Go into the clay, and tread the mortar.  Make the brick kiln strong.
003:015 There the fire will devour you.  The sword will cut you off.  It will
        devour you like the grasshopper.  Multiply like grasshoppers.
        Multiply like the locust.
003:016 You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the skies.
        The grasshopper strips, and flees away.
003:017 Your guards are like the locusts, and your officials like
        the swarms of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day,
        but when the sun appears, they flee away, and their place
        is not known where they are.
003:018 Your shepherds slumber, king of Assyria.  Your nobles lie down.
        Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no
        one to gather them.
003:019 There is no healing your wound, for your injury is fatal.
        All who hear the report of you clap their hands over you;
        for who hasn't felt your endless cruelty?
